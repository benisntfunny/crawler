Customize the activity timeline to display details on the events, tasks, logged calls, and sent emails linked to a record.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nThe Activity Timeline includes easy-to-scan summaries for the activities users normally see in the Open Activities and Activity History related lists. Sales reps can view past, present, and future activities at a glance on all standard and custom object records. Users can still access related lists as they did in Salesforce Classic.\n\nClick the arrow next to an individual activity (1) for a closer look at its description and comment fields. Or click Expand All (2) to see details for all activities in the timeline. You can choose to see only the activities that matter by filtering your timeline (3).\n\nYou can’t configure the first two rows of the activity timeline, but they were designed with sales rep performance in mind. For tasks, the first row (1) displays the task’s subject and due date. For events, it shows the subject and start date. And for logged calls and sent emails, it shows the subject and the logged or sent date. The second row (2) summarizes the activity. The summary is automatically generated to show the most useful information for the current context.\n\nYou can customize what sales reps see in the details section (3) by changing the compact layout for the current object. The details section is visible when an activity is expanded and includes fields from the activity’s compact layout.\n\nNext Steps: Customizing the Activity Timeline\nReview Activity Timeline Customization Considerations.\nFollow the steps in Customize the Fields that Display on Tasks in the Activity Timeline.\nCheck out Create Compact Layouts for more details on customizing activity details.\nView Notes on Compact Layouts to avoid complications.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
