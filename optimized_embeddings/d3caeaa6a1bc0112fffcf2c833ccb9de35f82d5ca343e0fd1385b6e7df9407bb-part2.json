You can use the Wellness Questionnaire as part of your organization's Health Verification strategy to screen event registrants for cold or flu-like symptoms associated with COVID-19.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions\n\nThe Wellness Questionnaire consists of a series of health screening questions that respondents must answer before being admitted into an event. The Wellness Questionnaire is templated and modifiable to support any additional public health screening questions in accordance with the event’s location and governing bodies.\n\nWhen the respondent completes and submits the questionnaire, they’re redirected to a confirmation page and a thank you page.\n\nAfter a respondent submits the Wellness Questionnaire, Safety Cloud automatically creates a Health Verification record and, using the questionnaire’s data mappings, maps the survey responses to fields on the record.\n\nAn agent reviews the Wellness Questionnaire responses on the respondent’s Health Verification record and determines whether to grant access to the event. Agents can assign these access levels to the respondent’s record.\n\nGranted\nRefused\nSet Up a Wellness Questionnaire for Health Verifications\nYou can access and set up a Wellness Questionnaire for Health Verifications.\nCustomize the Wellness Questionnaire\nYou can customize the Wellness Questionnaire by including the name of the event and the first and last name of the individual who is filling it out.\nConfigure Data Mappings for the Wellness Questionnaire\nThe Wellness Questionnaire comes preconfigured with default data mappings that map Wellness Questionnaire survey responses to fields on the Health Verification record. When a respondent submits the Wellness Questionnaire, Safety Cloud generates a Health Verification record and, using the questionnaire’s data mappings, maps the survey responses to the matching fields on the record.\nSEE ALSO\nConsiderations for the Safety Cloud Packages\nSalesforce Surveys and Feedback Management\nCompare Licenses and Supported Survey Capabilities\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
