The number of permission set licenses in your Salesforce org depends on your license configuration and on how your Industries solution is packaged. Permission set licenses entitle users to access features that aren’t included in their user licenses.\nCreate a Custom Permission Set\nA Salesforce org that has Business Rules Engine comes with a Rule Engine Designer permission set. If you want to create custom permission sets, clone and then modify the Rule Engine Designer permission set. For example, you can create a read-only permission set for users to only view and run but not create, edit, or delete expression sets.\nAssign a Permission Set to Users\nAssign a permission set to users to provide the users the required access to Business Rules Engine objects.\nPermissions for Community and Guest Users\nUsers with the community and guest user profiles can run expression sets and decision matrices when the profiles are assigned the permissions to run expression sets and decision matrices.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
