Publish definitions represent data extensions containing the filter and segment data you defined in the audience. Use publish definitions across the Marketing Cloud in other applications. Access your published definition in the Audience data extension folder, located in Email Studio under the Subscribers tab.\n\nPublish Features\nStatus - Shows status of an audience as either published or not published\nChannel - Shows which channel this audience published to\nNotifications Settings - Enter email addresses to notify upon the success or failure of a publish.\nSave Location - Navigate to the data extension folder to which to publish your audience\nSave Behavior - Defines how the system handles the published audience and its records if the data extension exists in the selected location.\nOverwrite existing records - This option replaces all records in the audience with new records.\nSave as new audience - This option saves records in a new data extension in the selected save location.\nWARNING Warning: Updates to the save behavior or audience name deletes the associated data extension, and active messages that use the edited audience fail.\nTracking Code - Enter a tracking a code for analytics and tracking purposes.\nCreate Publish Activity - After you select this checkbox, the system creates a new activity located in the Email Studio Interactions Section under Audience Builder. Use this activity in Email Studio Interactions or Automation Studio. The system only creates this activity once, and the activity inherits the name of the audience and is no longer selectable. We DO NOT change the name of the activity when you change the name of the audience.\nSegments to be published - Segments from the Segment tab appear here. You can select which ones you want to include in your published audience.\nPublish audience for each segment - Select this box to publish each segment selected as its own sendable audience.\nAttributes to be Appended - Select the attributes you want to append to your audience to use simple substitution strings to look up personalization values.\nPublish Preview - View an audience and segments before you publish the audience. Search for a specific subscriber key and see which segment they appear in. View appendable attributes of the preview subscribers.\nSave and Publish or Refresh and Publish - Click Save and Publish to publish the audience for the first time. Click Refresh and Publish to publish that audience again with refreshed information.\nPublish Preview\n\nPublish preview lets you view an audience and segments before you publish the audience in your account. Search for up to 10 specific subscriber keys and see which segment they appear in. You can also view appendable attributes of the previewed subscribers. If appending attributes for subscribers, you can view them in the appropriate column to validate your expectations before publishing.\n\nContact Global Support or your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account representative to enable this feature for your account.\n\nNOTE If you use capping and splitting, the previewed audience includes random contacts. We do not guarantee that the existence of a subscriber in the preview indicates that contacts appear in the published audience.\nNOTE If you uncheck a segment, the counts do not reflect the actual count of subscribers. We plan to resolve this known issue.\nInclude an Appended Attribute in Your Audience\nFollow these steps to include an appended attribute in your Audience Builder audience.\nNavigate to a Publish Definition\nFollow these steps to navigate to a publish definition in Audience Builder.\nPublish an Audience\nPublish an audience in Audience Builder to use with messaging in Marketing Cloud Engagement.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
