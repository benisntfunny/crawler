In Marketing Cloud Growth, templated campaign options simplify creating one piece of content or a multistep customer experience.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\nConsiderations for Campaigns in Marketing Cloud Growth\nWhen working with campaigns in Marketing Cloud Growth, keep these considerations in mind.\nCampaigns in Marketing Cloud Growth\nCampaigns act as a hub to organize and track all the parts of a marketing effort. A campaign can be as simple or as complex as you need, from sending a simple email to building out an automated, multistep customer experience.\nSegment-Triggered Campaign Flows in Marketing Cloud Growth\nSegment-triggered campaign flows send messages based on segment membership. The preconfigured campaign flow includes only email messages, but you can add SMS messages to any segment-triggered flow if you have the paid SMS add-on.\nForm-Triggered Campaign Flows in Marketing Cloud Growth\nA form-triggered campaign flow includes a form and a landing page, and is triggered when someone submits the form. These flows also include an action to create lead records from form submissions and an action to create consent records for marketing messages.\nHow Campaigns and Flows Work Together\nIn Marketing Cloud Growth, each campaign you create starts with a flow. The campaign record is a hub for your marketing effort, while the campaign flow automates content distribution and data collection. For more robust campaigns, add additional flows from the campaign record. Each flow inherits its name from the campaign.\nExamples of Campaign Use Cases in Marketing Cloud Growth\nWhen you create a campaign, think about your goal. Who are you trying to reach? How and when are the best ways to reach them? Answering these questions helps you choose the right flow to start with, and decide how to add to your campaign.\nCampaign Members in Marketing Cloud Growth\nRelate leads or contacts to a campaign to help you plan, report on engagement, and analyze the success of a campaign. The campaign member object creates a direct relationship between the campaign and the lead or contact.\nWorking with Campaigns and Flows in Marketing Cloud Growth\nFor a multitouch customer experience, use Flow Builder to extend your campaign. Use flow elements to listen for activities, trigger actions, and add steps to your customer’s journey.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
