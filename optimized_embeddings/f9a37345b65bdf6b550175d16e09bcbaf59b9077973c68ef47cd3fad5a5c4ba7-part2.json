That way, the data in the production org isn’t accidentally masked. When the configuration is complete, you can mask your sandbox data. Run the mask each time you want to replace or delete the data in your sandbox.\n\nFrom your Configuration tab in your sandbox, click Run and then Confirm.\nTo monitor the progress of a masking run, click the Jobs tab and then the mask name link. From the Affected Records section, you can choose to wrap or clip the text for any of the fields from the dropdown. To open another masking run or investigate any errors, close the tab.\nSUMMARY ITEMS\tDESCRIPTION\nScheduled or Summary\tThe date and time that the mask runs. For a manual mask run, it shows a summary, otherwise it shows the scheduled run time. The summary explains the job status. For example, in the queue, it identifies whether a job is completed. It shows the configuration from where the job was created. If a configuration is deleted after a job runs, it displays [Deleted].\n[Object Name]\tThe status of the field now being masked. For example, for a contact, you see loading records, acting on records, and clean up.\nJobs Completed\tA green check mark indicates that the masking job is complete.\nAffected Records (X)\tIf any of the records are affected during the mask run, you see the object name, number matched, deleted, masked, or errors. By closing the dialog, you can view another mask job or investigate any errors from the Failures section.\nErrors\tIt shows the object name, its record id, the type of error, and any associated message.\nTo verify that records are masked properly, manually spot-check your sandbox data. Then you can grant more users access to the sandbox.\n\nThe masking process runs asynchronously and can take several hours for large sandboxes. Data Mask bypasses these automations during execution, including objects from Managed Packages.\n\nTriggers\nWorkflow Rules\nValidation Rules\nFlows\nFeed Tracking\n\nData Mask also deletes all Field History Tracking associated with the Object when the masking job is complete.\n\nIf the Email Deliverability setting is set to All Emails, you receive an email when the job completes.\n\nStop Data Mask Job\nYou can stop a current running data mask job.\nSEE ALSO\nGuidelines for Configuring Deliverability Settings for Emails Sent from Salesforce\nData Mask Considerations\nStop Data Mask Job\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
