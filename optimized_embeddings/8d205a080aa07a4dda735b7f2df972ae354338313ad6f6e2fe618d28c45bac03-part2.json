If you add, remove, or change fields on your form, also make sure the updated fields are mapped properly.\nIf you add a supported data source field to your form, and the field type changes to an unsupported type, the changed field disappears from the Fields list. However, the field isn’t removed from the form. Manually remove the unsupported field from the form.\nUnpublishing a landing page doesn’t affect its related form. If needed, unpublish the form and deactivate its related flow.\nIn orgs with duplicate rules, the flow related to a form doesn’t create a lead, contact, or person account record if the information submitted by the form matches an existing record.\nTo add an image that’s hosted outside of Marketing Cloud Growth to a landing page, you must allowlist the domain that hosts the image using the Content Security Policy (CSP) directives in Trusted URLs in Setup. See Manage Trusted URLs.\nLimitations\nOnly one form can be added to a landing page.\nA form can be related to only one flow.\nA form can't be embedded on an external website.\nWhen a flow is automatically generated from a form, the flow isn’t automatically related to a campaign. You must manually relate the flow to a campaign before the flow can be activated.\nYou can change the field type of a custom field referenced on a form only if the form supports the new field type.\nBefore a landing page can be published, its form must have a flow related to it.\nWhen a form is built with Salesforce object fields from a data source, the fields inherit the language of the person building the form, not the language associated with the workspace.\nTo capture form submission data, these fields must have specific unique name values.\nEmail address fields must have the unique name “Email”.\nFirst name fields must have the unique name “FirstName”.\nLast name fields must have the unique name “LastName”.\n\nCapitalization doesn’t matter as long as the right letters are there without any extra characters. For example, an email address field with the unique name of “email”, “Email”, or “EmAiL” appears on a web engagement report. An email address field with the unique name “Email123” doesn’t.\n\nSEE ALSO\nCreate and Publish a Form in Marketing Cloud Growth\nUnpublish a Form in Marketing Cloud Growth\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
