You can pause a preparing, activated, or finishing segment-triggered campaign flow so that you can fix an issue or make other changes.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create and edit flows:\t\n\nMarketing Manager permission set\n\nOR\n\nView Flows and Create and Edit Flows user permissions AND Permissions to all elements in the flow\n\nLearn more about Marketing Cloud Growth Permissions\n\nHow It Works\n\nA flow must have a status of Preparing, Activated, or Finishing to be paused. When you pause, the segment members are held where they are until you resume the flow. When you resume, Flow Builder processes the segment members in the paused queue where they were when you paused the flow.\n\nFlow Builder accounts for the time elapsed since you paused the flow. If your flow contains a Wait for Amount of Time or Wait Until Date element, the flow, the pause duration is included in the total wait time.\n\nWhen you resume a changed flow, you must create a new flow version. Before you activate the new version, choose to complete any work, such as unsent email or SMS messages, or cancel them.\n\nComplete work: Previous work is completed and the new activated version processes all new work.\nCancel work: Queued work from the previous paused version is permanently deleted.\nEXAMPLE\nYou pause your email campaign flow because you have updated artwork. You want to send queued emails from the previous version, but send the updated version to anyone who hasn’t started the flow yet. When you activate the new version of the paused campaign flow, you choose to complete work.\nYour campaign’s email is intended for existing high value customers. You pause your email campaign flow when you realize that the audience segment includes new customers only. You don’t want anyone else to get the email because the information isn’t intended for new customers. When you activate a new version with the correct segment, you choose to cancel work.\nYour email series has a Wait for Amount of Time element that is set to wait 48 hours. Twelve hours into the pause period, you pause the flow for 12 hours, and then resume it. Since 24 hours have elapsed since you paused the flow, it begins sending the next email 24 hours later.\nPause a Campaign Flow\n\nIn Marketing Cloud Growth, you can pause a segment-triggered flow from the Flow Builder canvas.\n\nOpen a flow for editing.\nFrom a single email campaign, click the action menu, and then select Edit Flow.\nFrom other campaigns, click Edit Flow.\nFrom the Flows tab, click a row action menu, and then select View Flow.\nOn the button bar, click Pause.\nAdd a reason for pausing the flow.\nClick Pause.\n\nThe status badge changes to Paused. When you’re ready to resume your flow, click Resume. If you edited your flow, the current version of the flow remains on the campaign until you activate the new version.\n\nDeactivate a Paused Campaign Flow\n\nIn Marketing Cloud Growth, you can deactivate a paused segment-triggered flow from the Flow Builder canvas.\n\nBefore you deactivate a paused flow, decide whether to allow individuals in the flow to complete it or to cancel the flow completely and remove all individuals from the flow.\n\nComplete work: The flow deactivates, but remains in Finishing status until all individuals already in it to complete it.\nCancel work: The flow deactivates immediately and shows a status of Canceled.\nOpen the paused flow for editing.\nFrom a single email campaign, click the action menu, and then select Edit Flow.\nFrom other campaigns, click Edit Flow.\nFrom the Flows tab, click a row action menu, and then select View Flow.\nClick Deactivate.\nChoose what to do with in-progress work.\nTo deactivate the flow and cancel in-progress work, select Deactivate and complete work.\nTo deactivate the flow and complete any in-progress work, select Deactivate and complete work.\nClick Deactivate.\nWhen you cancel in-progress work, the status badge changes to Canceled.\nWhen you complete in-progress work, the status badge changes to Finishing. After the flow finishes the in-progress work, the status changes to Canceled.\nPause Support by Flow Status\n\nIn Marketing Cloud Growth, flows can be paused when they have certain statuses only.\n\nCan I Pause a Segment-Triggered Flow?\nFLOW STATUS\tCAN YOU PAUSE?\tDETAILS\nPreparing\tYes\tA flow that’s preparing resources hasn’t started processing data yet, so you can pause it. If you edit the flow, you must save it as a new version.\nActivated\tYes\tAn activated flow is running, but you can pause it. If you edit the flow, you must save it as a new version.\nFinishing\tYes\tA flow that’s finishing allows individuals who were in the flow when it was canceled to complete it, but doesn’t accept new individuals. A flow that's finishing can be paused because the flow is still running. If you edit the flow, you must save it as a new version.\nCompleted\tNo\tThe flow finished running so it can’t be paused.\nScheduled\tNo\tA scheduled flow can’t be paused because it hasn’t started running. However, you can deactivate it, make changes, and activate it again.\nCanceled\tNo\tA canceled flow can’t be modified or paused, but you can save it as a new version, make changes, and activate it.\nDraft\tNo\tA draft flow hasn’t been activated yet, so it can’t be paused.\nError\tNo\tA flow with an error status can’t be paused because it’s not running. Review error details for instructions on how to address the error.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
