For the data that businesses choose to store, they can be required to pseudo-anonymize or anonymize that data as much as possible. To stay compliant with privacy law, businesses can use the Data Management Policies feature in Privacy Center to automate how data is deleted or masked.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Developer, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions. Requires the Privacy Center license.\n\nData management policies use the Privacy Policy object to execute masking and deletion transformation actions that you set for targeted data. For each top-level object in your Data Management policy, you create one or more actions. Each object action includes:\n\nCriteria to filter and identify the records to be processed\nAn object transformation action to mask or delete\nField and file-level actions to mask or delete\n\nThe filter criteria are based on the fields on the object. The criteria also support the ability to define parent conditions, where the filter checks the value of a related record up to 5 levels higher in the hierarchy. You can also define criteria on child records, which have a lookup or master-detail relationship to the current record by using cross-object queries.\n\nHow to Use Data Management Policies\nUse Data Management policies to remove or mask data that you no longer want to store. Common reasons to transform data include when a data subject is no longer a customer or when data has aged out of use in your system. Included are examples of how to use Data Management policies for these use cases.\nHow to Configure Data Management Policies\nLearn how to configure a Data Management Policy with our step-by-step guide.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
