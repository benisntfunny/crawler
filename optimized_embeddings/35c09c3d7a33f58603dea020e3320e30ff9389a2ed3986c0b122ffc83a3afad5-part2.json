System integrations are optional. You can generate a Health Verification without any integrations.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions\n\nSafety Cloud supports integration with these systems.\n\nEvent management and registrations systems such as RainFocus\nCOVID-19 vendor testing systems such as eMed, ixlayer, and Senneca\nEmail marketing systems such as Marketing Cloud Engagement\n\nSafety Cloud comes with named credentials and Auth Providers for ixlayer, eMed, Senneca, and RainFocus.\n\nNOTE If you want your Safety Cloud solution to include third-party integrations, you must contract separately with the third party to use their systems.\nManaging Safety Cloud Integrations\n\nYou can use the Named Credentials feature in the Setup UI for authorization to the integrated systems.\n\nSafety Cloud supports these authorizations with named credentials.\n\nAPI Key\n\nAPI Key authorization involves a one-use system password. If you use an API key, you must set the password to the API key of the system using the API Key credential.\n\neMed, ixlayer, RainFocus, and Senneca use this authorization method.\n\nUsername & Password\n\nUsername and password authorization requires the username and password provided to you by the integration with which you’re integrating. The username and password enables communication between Safety Cloud and the system with which it’s integrating.\n\nIf you use a username and password authorization, you must change the URL field to the API endpoint of the integration.\n\nOAuth\n\nOAuth authorization uses an authentication provider. QAuth is used in parallel with the Named Credentials. You can define authentication providers with the Auth.Provider from the Setup UI.\n\nFor more information, see Authentication Providers.\n\nHow Safety Cloud Communicates with Integrated Systems\n\nSafety Cloud comes with default Apex classes, which you can schedule to retrieve data from supported testing vendors for events such as eMed, ixlayer, Senneca. You can schedule these classes to run at any interval to create Health Verifications from the returned values.\n\nExample of scheduling a provided integration class\n\neMed\n\nSystem.schedule('Scheduled Job 1', '0 30 * * * ?', new \nsafetycloud.ScheduleEMedGetResults());\n\nSenneca:\n\nSystem.schedule('Scheduled Job 1', '0 30 * * * ?', new \nsafetycloud.ScheduleSennecaBatch());\n\nixlayer:\n\nSystem.schedule('Scheduled Job 1', '0 30 * * * ?', new \nsafetycloud.ScheduleIXLayerImport());\nIntegration Data Mapping\n\nAfter integrations are authenticated and returning data, there are options to customize how fields get populated on Health Verifications from the response.\n\nYou can use the Integration Field Mapping Custom Metadata type to configure how values from an integration response get mapped to fields on a Health Verification record.\n\nTo configure the Integration Field Mapping custom metadata records, follow these steps.\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Custom Metadata Types, and then select Custom Metadata Types.\nFind the Integration Field Mapping Custom Metadata Type, and select Manage Records.\n\nA list of preconfigured field mappings that come with Safety Cloud are displayed.\n\nTo create a mapping, click New.\n\nField values to set:\n\nLabel: Name of the custom label can be anything. Used for identification, not functional.\nIntegration Field Mapping Name: Name of the integration field mapping can be anything. Used for identification, not functional.\nActive: Boolean active/inactive integration field mapping\n\nIf inactive, this field isn’t mapped to a Health Verification.\n\nDescription: A short description of this field\nData Type: Specifies how the data from the external system lives in Salesforce\nData Type Format: Format of how this Date field exists in Salesforce.\n\nCurrently only used for Date formatting\n\nDestination Object: The object that contains the field to be mapped from the external system.\n\nCurrently only Health Verifications are supported, but custom logic could be written for other objects.\n\nDestination Field Name: Which field the data from the external system maps to.\n\nThe Destination Field Name is the API name of a field on the Health Verification. The value specified in the Source Field Name populates this field.\n\nSource Field Name: The Source Field Name points to the name of a field (key) in the JSON response returned by the external system.\n\nThe value in that field is stamped on the Health Verification field specified in the Destination Field Name.\n\nHere’s a snippet of a JSON file from an external system that contains a sample test result for a person attending an event. For example, you can store the date of this person’s test. Use this format to query the JSON file.\n\nwith.results.results.time_x\n\n\nHere’s an example.\n\n\n{\n   \"this\":\"succeeded\",\n   \"with\":{\n      \"results\":[\n         {\n            \"id\":\"fvM8aPYkWf3s41jsueYsW\",\n            \"partnerID\":\"Kp4MBkcnRh5HZFCMV54Zf\",\n            \"clientID\":\"fy1a4km2OQvgT4kiTEEMA\",\n            \"profile\":{\n               \"firstName\":\"dbbfefa577e8b8ad8eee368d5e9797549601cbbad66ce5a8aa026675aba082c7\",\n               \"lastName\":\"f4b24fed0274a31618ac1b665ee162af331b4b70fdff74f3f9ddedc94b4da745\",\n               \"email\":\"91f904ab85aaacce6f5e7471a469dd4baeb555a07bfe0f930bdd138273b3b129\",\n               \"dob\":\"a386c6a859ed6be3d648414f8a67b357c4f18162ae0176cc3b3eaaa3f8a8904b\"\n            },\n            \"state\":\"sf004\",\n            \"results\":[\n               {\n                  \"time_x\":\"2022-01-21T17:30:15.797Z\",\n                  \"procedureID\":\"sample\",\n\nEnsure That Safety Cloud and Integrated Systems Speak the Same Language\n\nIntegrated systems must speak the same language for them to work together.\n\nSafety Cloud includes utility classes and mappings, which are defined as prebuilt connectors for supported systems. If you want to create your own mappings, you must build and test them.\n\nThe results from a Health Verification record have been standardized. The current mapping for the Health Verification record includes these fields.\n\nHealth Verification Method and Source\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nEmail\nTest Result\nDate and Time of test\nTest ID and External ID.\n\nAdditional mapping isn’t supported.\n\nTest Your Safety Cloud Integrations\n\nTo test your integrations:\n\nUsing an Extract Transform Load (ETL) platform of your choosing, convert test results from another system into Health Verifications. Use this pattern.\nPoll the same results from any vendor.\nMap the vendor's system to a Health Verification object.\nInsert the record, and run any automation on it.\nCreate Auth Providers and Named Credentials\nSafety Cloud comes with named credentials and Auth Providers for ixlayer, eMed, Senneca, and RainFocus.\nSEE ALSO\nCustom Triggers\nEmail Templates and Notifications\nQR Code Generation\nConfigure Safety Cloud to Generate QR Codes Automatically\nPerson Accounts\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
