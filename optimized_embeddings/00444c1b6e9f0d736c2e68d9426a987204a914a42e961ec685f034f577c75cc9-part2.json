Use the order summary to manage the entire order lifecycle.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nWhen a shopper or buyer submits an order from your ecommerce storefront, the details of the transaction are transmitted to Order Management and two data objects are created: an order and an order summary. The order, which represents the initial transaction, becomes the foundation of the order summary. At this point, all information in the order and order summary match, the order is locked, and all subsequent order activity is tracked using the order summary.\n\nOrder Management also creates other order objects to represent specific elements, such as products, payments, and shipping. In addition, substantive changes to an order, such as a cancellation or return, generate a change order object. As an order moves through the order lifecycle stages, the order summary is updated so that you always have a current view of an order’s status.\n\nFrom the order summary, you can see all information about the order, including:\n\nWho placed the order and when it was submitted\nWhat was ordered (products, quantities, and prices)\nWhat items have been allocated\nWhat items have been fulfilled\nWhat items can be canceled or returned\nWhat items have been canceled\nWhat items have been returned\nWhere and how items were shipped\nHow much money has been authorized, captured, and invoiced\nHow much money has been refunded on returned and canceled items\nAll activity on the order since it was submitted\nActive process exception alerts\n\nYou can access related records from links on the Order Summary page in the Order Management Console.\n\nTRANSACTION ORDER ATTRIBUTES\tORDER SUMMARY ATTRIBUTES\n\nRepresents the shopper’s or buyer’s intent, including order creation (order) and changes (change order)\nAssociated with one order summary\nDoesn’t change after it’s activated\nCan be used to report bookings\n\t\nProvides a single view of the current state of an order, including fulfillment status, order changes, cancellations, and returns\nCan’t exist without the original transaction order\nIs read-only for financial order data\nSEE ALSO\nOrder Management Objects\nOrder Management Lifecycle\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
