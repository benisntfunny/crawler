Customize column preferences when creating lists according to business needs. Edit actionable lists to update name, description, priority, and list status. Refresh lists by adding latest dataset records to existing actionable lists. Add more members to existing actionable lists.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Clouds that have Industry Sales Excellence and Query for Datapipelines User licenses\nCreate Actionable Lists From List Definitions\nCreate an actionable list by using an actionable list definition. You can specify list filtering criteria when creating a list. Before creating a list, ensure that your Salesforce admin has already created and activated the actionable list definition that you plan to use.\nEdit Actionable Lists\nList creators can edit an existing actionable list to change its name, description, priority, and list status.\nAdd Latest Matching Dataset Records to Actionable Lists\nAs a list creator, manually add the latest dataset records that match the filter criteria associated with the list to get an up-to-date actionable list.\nAdd More Members to Actionable Lists\nAdd more members to an existing actionable list, which helps list creators to revise the member list iteratively based on the changing business needs.\nUpdate List Member Count with Flow\nList creators must run the List Member Count API to get the latest count of list members if these members are added to the list through APEX code or Connect API. Use a flow with HTTP Callout action to invoke the List Member Count API, which is a no-code approach and helps you to update the list member count easily and quickly.\nAdd Members to Actionable Lists with a Quick Action\nList creators can add account, contact, case, opportunity, and lead records to existing actionable lists quickly with the Add to an Actionable List quick action. List creators can use this quick action from list views on object pages or from record pages.\nShare Actionable Lists\nLike all Salesforce objects, actionable lists are governed by your sharing model. To make sure that the right colleagues have access to the right lists, a list creator can extend sharing for your own lists one by one.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
