As part of the plan, decide on the strategies for moving users to the new interface (all at once or in groups) and for preparing them for the coming change. We recommend rolling out in phases, starting with a pilot, so you don’t have to do everything at once and can learn and refine as you go. The same goes for your rollout plan. Don’t over-plan now and iterate on priorities after each group that you transition.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nPick a Rollout Strategy\nIn your Lightning Experience rollout plan, define the approach you’ll use to move users to the new interface. Pick a strategy that works for your company's size, business goals, and the complexity of your Salesforce implementation. There are three common approaches: move everyone at the same time, move users gradually in groups, or start over with a new org. We recommend taking a phased approach, starting with a pilot group.\nPick the Users and Define the Scope of Work for Each Group in Your Rollout\nIf you’re using a phased approach for your Lightning Experience rollout, develop a roadmap that shows how many groups you’re planning on. And for each group, indicate the affected user profiles, the scope of work, and the estimated schedule. Prioritize new features and technical work by the needs of the users in each group. Don’t worry about making the list perfect because you’ll refine the priorities after you get real user feedback from your pilot group.\nDevelop a Change Management Strategy\nAnother critical component of your Lightning Experience rollout plan is how to manage the change for your Salesforce users when they move to the new interface. Failing to adequately prepare users ahead of time puts your transition project at risk. Get a sense of your company’s readiness for change, then use your findings to define a change management strategy.\nOther Considerations for Your Rollout Plan\nThere are other things to consider for your Lightning Experience rollout plan, such as metrics for measuring success.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
