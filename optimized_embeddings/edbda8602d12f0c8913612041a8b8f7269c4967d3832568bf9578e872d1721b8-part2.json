Turn on Einstein Lead Scoring, and then select a lead conversion milestone to use, which leads to score, and which lead fields to consider during scoring.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic.\nAvailable with Sales Cloud Einstein, which is available for an extra cost in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo enable Einstein Lead Scoring:\t\n\nCustomize Application\n\nAND\n\nModify All Data\n\nAND\n\nView All Profiles\n\nGo to Setup. In the Quick Find box, enter Einstein Lead Scoring, and select Einstein Lead Scoring under Einstein Sales.\nTurn on Einstein Lead Scoring.\nChoose whether to use default settings or custom settings.\nIf you choose default settings, Einstein looks for leads converted to accounts and contacts, scores all of your leads together, and considers all lead fields during scoring. When using default settings, you can skip the remaining steps and click Score Leads.\nIf you chose custom settings, on the Conversion Milestone page, choose the lead conversion milestone (accounts and contacts or opportunity creation) that matches your business practices. Does your sales team simply convert leads to accounts and contacts, or do they create opportunities when they convert leads? Then click Save & Next.\nOn the Lead Segments page, choose whether you want Einstein to score all of your leads together, or only certain segments of your leads that meet criteria you specify. To score segments of your leads separately, click Segments of Leads. Otherwise, click Save & Next.\nWhy would you want to score segments of your leads separately? Let’s say you have domestic leads and international leads. Their conversion patterns could have significant differences. If you use the Country field to put them in different segments, Einstein can calculate more accurate scores based on those patterns. Define your segments based on the criteria that make sense for your business.\nIf you want Einstein to score segments of your leads separately, click Add Segment.\nGive the segment a name of up to 80 characters.\nChoose whether to include records that meet all of your conditions or any of your conditions.\nTo add filter criteria for the segment, click Add Condition and then choose a field, operator, type and value.\n\nYou can specify up to 100 field filters for the leads you want to score. The CurrencyIsoCode field can’t be used in lead field filters.\n\nThe following field data types also can’t be used in lead field filters.\n\nAddress\nDate\nDatetime\nDouble\nEncrypted String\nGeolocation\nMultipicklist\nReference — However, the RecordTypeId reference field is supported.\nText Area\nTime\nAdd any other conditions you want the segment to meet.\nRepeat the process for any additional lead segments you want to create. You can create up to 35 segments.\n\nLeads that don’t meet the conditions for any segment are ignored when Einstein builds the predictive model.\n\nIf you created more than one lead segment, drag them into priority order. If a lead falls into multiple segments, Einstein scores it as part of the highest priority segment.\nWhen you’re done adding segments, click Save & Next.\nOn the Included Fields page, choose whether you want Einstein to include all your lead fields when building the predictive model for each lead segment. By default, Einstein includes all lead fields. To include only certain fields, click Include Fields... and then deselect the fields you don’t want Einstein to include. When you’re done, click Next.\n\nWhy would you tell Einstein not to include some fields? Some businesses use fields that don’t affect a lead’s chance of converting. For example, you could have a field that indicates the reason a lead didn’t convert. Telling Einstein to exclude those fields yields more accurate lead scores. Before excluding a field, make sure that the field doesn't affect the lead's chance of converting. Excluding fields that do affect score analysis decreases the accuracy of your lead scores. If you’re uncertain about whether to exclude a particular field, include it and then check the Einstein Lead Scoring dashboard to see what effect it has on your scores.\n\nIf you tell Einstein to score all leads together in the All Leads (Default) segment, Einstein includes any new fields you add to leads automatically. If you create lead segments, add any new fields to your segments manually in Setup. If you decide to delete an included field from the Lead object, exclude the field from all segments and wait for Einstein to update your scores before deleting it.\n\nOn the Review Settings page, confirm your choices. If you want, you can edit them.\nWhen you’re done, click Score Leads.\nEinstein analyzes your teams’ past converted leads to build a scoring model for each lead segment. It can take up to 48 hours to analyze your data, build a scoring model for each lead segment, and add scores to leads. To check the status, return to the Einstein Lead Scoring setup page.\n\nWhen you score all leads together without creating segments, and you don’t have enough lead conversion data to build your own predictive model, Einstein uses a global model. The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough lead data, Einstein builds a scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\n\nUsing the Lightning App Builder, make sure that the Einstein Lead Scoring component was added to Lightning pages for leads. In Salesforce Classic, add the Lead Score field to lead page layouts. The Lead Score field can’t be used on the same page layout as the Lead Score Distribution or Conversion Rate by Lead Score report components.\n\nTo see the Einstein Lead Scoring component, users must have read access to the Company, Phone, and Email fields on leads.\n\nAfter scores are available, add the Lead Score field to public lead list views. Salesforce automatically adds this field to default list views.\nTIP To get the most out of Einstein Lead Scoring, tell sales reps to add the Lead Score field to their lead list views.\n\nIf you want to update your lead scoring setup, your changes become draft settings until you click Score Leads again. You can save your draft settings and update them as often as necessary before using them to score leads.\n\nIf you choose to change your Einstein Lead Scoring settings, and CRM Analytics Data Sync is also enabled, you can see errors during data sync. These errors occur because the ScoreIntelligenceId field on leads is unavailable for data sync while Einstein rebuilds your lead scoring model. The data sync errors resolve when the model is rebuilt, and updated scores appear on lead records.\n\nIf you previously turned off Einstein Lead Scoring and are turning it back on, update settings in the Einstein Lead Scoring app in Analytics Studio.\n\nIn Analytics Studio, click the Einstein Lead Scoring app.\nClick Reconfigure app. If you don’t see that link, click New version available.\nRead the message about overwriting existing customizations, and then select It’s OK to overwrite current app and any customizations.\nClick Continue.\nSEE ALSO\nSelect Who Can Use Sales Cloud Einstein\nConsiderations for Setting Up Einstein Lead Scoring\nEinstein Lead Scoring\nTroubleshoot Sales Cloud Einstein Setup Errors\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
