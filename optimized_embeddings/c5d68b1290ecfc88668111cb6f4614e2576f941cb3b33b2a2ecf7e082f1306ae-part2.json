You need a support plan that addresses post-launch tasks, including managing MFA operations and helping users solve authentication or verification method problems. It’s also important to establish who owns these responsibilities.\n\nHere are some recommendations and considerations for your MFA support plan.\n\nSupport Team\tFigure out who owns day-to-day operations, such as your help desk or a third-party service provider. Identify the right contacts on the support team and invite them to provide input into your project plan.\nPolicies and Processes\t\n\nDefine and document how your support team handles common issues, such as:\n\nSolving login problems, including failed authentication attempts and account lockouts.\nHelping users recover access if they forget or lose their verification method, get a new method, or a registered method stops working.\nEnabling MFA for new users.\n\nUpdate your user onboarding procedures so new hires have MFA enabled on their first day. Ensure that MFA registration assistance is included in your new employee onboarding processes.\n\n\nTraining\tDecide how to impart MFA knowledge to your Support team. Consider holding a training session. Prioritize creating the documentation that’s necessary for Support agents to troubleshoot and resolve user problems.\nOperational Budget\t\n\nEstablish a budget for managing your MFA implementation. Plan for the possibility of a higher volume of Support cases in the first few weeks after launching MFA.\n\nIf you’re using security keys, account for the cost of maintaining a supply of these devices, and distributing replacement keys to users.\n\nAccess Recovery Process\n\nIt’s likely that some users, at some point, will need to recover their verification method. A clearly documented recovery process — for admins and end users — is an important part of your MFA support plan. Establish a process that reduces the risks associated with a lost method, and quickly restores a user’s Salesforce access.\n\nTIP Make your recovery process easy and blame-free so users feel safe to immediately report a lost device or verification method.\n\nConsider building these steps into your recovery process:\n\nEnd the user’s current session.\nDisconnect the lost verification method.\nRe-establish login access.\nAudit the user’s account activity to watch for any unusual activity.\nIf the user’s verification method was lost or stolen, guide them through the process to get a replacement.\nHave an Access Recovery Plan for Salesforce Admins Too!\n\nMake sure your access recovery plan accounts for the possibility of Salesforce admins getting locked out or losing access to their verification method. If you're the only admin for your Salesforce environment, you need a special recovery plan just for you! Consider these best practices:\n\nEach admin registers at least two verification methods.\n\nKeep a backup security key in a secure place at work.\n\nIn addition to yourself, ensure there's at least one other trusted user who has permission to manage users and MFA settings (including the Manage Multi-Factor Authentication in User Interface user permission). This way, if you get locked out, the other user can restore your access.\n\nSEE ALSO\nGet Ready to Support Your MFA Implementation\nSupport Your MFA Implementation\nRecover Access for MFA-Enabled Users for Products Built on the Salesforce Platform\nDelegate Multi-Factor Authentication Management Tasks\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
