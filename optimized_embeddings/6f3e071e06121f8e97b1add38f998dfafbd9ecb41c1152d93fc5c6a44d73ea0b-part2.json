You can transform the data for standard and custom objects, and Analytics datasets using Data Processing Engine definitions.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Professional Editions with Financial Services Cloud, Manufacturing Cloud, Loyalty Management, Net Zero Cloud, Rebate Management, Accounting Subledger, or Provider Search in Health Cloud\n\nWatch the video to see how Data Processing Engine works and how you can use DPE to transform data:\n\nIf you aren’t able to watch the video in full screen, open the video in a new tab:https://salesforce.vidyard.com/watch/rZzBj9BD6SoW4pM5pnbNeF\n\nAfter you activate a Data Processing Engine definition, you can use a flow to run it. And you can track each run by using Monitor Workflow Services.\n\nEnable Data Pipelines\nTo create and run Data Processing Engine definitions, enable Data Pipelines. With Data Pipelines you can query and compute data that's available in your Salesforce org.\nPermissions to Work with Data Processing Engine\nYour Salesforce org and users require permissions and access to create, activate, and run Data Processing Engine definitions.\nData Processing Engine Builder\nGet to know the Data Processing Engine Builder before you work with it.\nData Processing Engine Runtimes\nTo efficiently handle industry cloud data, Data Processing Engine supports two off-core runtimes: CRM Analytics and Data Cloud.\nData Processing Engine Workflow\nLet’s look at the steps an admin completes to set up and run a Data Processing Engine definition.\nData Processing Engine Nodes\nEach node type in the Data Processing Engine lets you transform your data in a different way. Examples include joining two datasets, calculating a field value using formulas, and appending a dataset to another dataset.\nDefine Input Variables\nInput variables allow you to define a default value that can be used in Filter and Formula nodes. Define input variables and use them in filter and formula nodes.\nCreate a Data Processing Engine Definition\nYou can create multiple Data Processing Engine definitions based on your business requirements.\nRun Data Processing Engine Definitions\nYou can run a Data Processing Engine definition using Flows or from the definition's builder. Use Flows when you want to run a definition on a particular schedule or when the definition is part of another business process. Run a definition from the builder when you want the run to process specific input variable values so that you can test and validate the writeback results.\nMonitor Your Data Processing Engine Definition Runs\nMonitor definition runs to see if the runs succeed or fail. In Monitor Workflow Services, you can view the status of a Data Processing Engine definition's run and its individual tasks. In the Data Manager of Data Pipelines, monitor the data sync and the recipe for the run.\nTrack Your Data Processing Engine Usage\nData Processing Engine definition runs can process and write back data up to a specific size. If your Salesforce org reaches a daily or monthly limit, the definitions stop running.\nShare Data Processing Engine Definitions\nYou can create a Data Processing Engine definition and share it with other Salesforce orgs using managed and unmanaged packages and change sets. Partners and independent software vendors (ISV) can create and share definitions with their customers.\nDelete a Data Processing Engine Definition\nDelete inactive Data Processing Engine definitions that you aren’t using. Before you delete a definition, make sure that it’s not referenced in any flow.\nData Processing Engine Best Practices\nBefore you create and run a Data Processing Engine definition, understand the best practices.\nData Processing Engine Limits\nWhile creating and running Data Processing Engine definitions, keep the limits and limitations in mind.\nTroubleshoot Data Processing Engine Issues\nCan’t seem to get Data Processing Engine working for you? To resolve issues with Data Processing Engine, try these solutions.\nData Processing Engine Developer Resources\nYou can create, activate, and run Data Processing Engine definitions using developer resources.\nProvide Purchase Credit to Accounts and Reward Salespeople Based on Orders (Example)\nCloud Kicks provides a 5% year-end purchase credit to accounts based on their total effective orders that ended between January 1 and November 30. The salespeople associated with these orders are also rewarded with 0.5% of the total order amount as a bonus. The purchase credit and bonus are granted to the accounts and salespeople on December 1 each year.\nSEE ALSO\nStreamline Forecast Calculations with Data Processing Engine Definitions\nCalculate Component Forecasts with Data Processing Engine Templates for Program Based Business\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
