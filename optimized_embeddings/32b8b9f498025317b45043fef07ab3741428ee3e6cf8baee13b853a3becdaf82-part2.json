After you set up the categories, the seller can match their products to the Marketplace categories or suggest new ones. For a product to be displayed on the storefront shelf, it must be associated with an active category in Commerce Marketplace.\n\nCategory Tree\nYour hierarchical category tree is imported when you implement the Marketplace. We recommend registering the category structure in B2C Commerce so that you can update, edit, and delete it in Commerce Marketplace. You customize category objects and improve the Search Engine Optimizer directly in B2C Commerce.\nMarketplace Category\nMarketplace categories are synchronized with the Seller Portal, and sellers can sort their products in the available categories. A seller can also create categories, which are placed under Seller Categories. However, a seller can request to add the seller category to the Marketplace categories. Matches are automatically approved when a seller category is associated with an existing Marketplace category. You can configure the approval flow to manually approve or reject all matches.\nConfigure Sharing Rules for Categories\nYou can configure the Import Settings sharing rules to let sellers upload category records, view categories that you’ve created, and link the categories to their products. You can also restrict a particular seller from seeing categories created or suggested by another seller.\nProduct Full Category Path\nYou can have a product be under all categories, instead of only one. For example, a product like “carrot” can be under the Supermarkets, Vegetables, and Organics associated categories.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
