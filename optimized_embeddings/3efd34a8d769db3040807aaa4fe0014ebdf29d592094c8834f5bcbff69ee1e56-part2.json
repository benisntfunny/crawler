Deploy it after you complete the Wealth Management implementation tasks. Dashboards from the Client Segmentation App app replace Financial Services Cloud embedded dashboards available on the Advisor Analytics tab.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in Lightning Experience in Enterprise and Unlimited editions that have Financial Services Cloud enabled.\nNOTE Client Segmentation App is not part of CRM Analytics for Financial Services, which is a separate application enabled by its own license and available for extra cost.\n\nClient Segmentation App app dashboards are based on the latest CRM Analytics dashboard designer. The older classic designer will be retired on June 30, 2019, and the Advisor Analytics tab will no longer be available in Financial Services Cloud. Customers are advised to remove the Advisor Analytics tab before then. Contact your Salesforce representative to learn more about the transition.\n\nIf you installed the Financial Services Cloud – Einstein Analytics managed package, replace it by using the Client Segmentation App template. The template creates an app with dashboards that your team accesses through CRM Analytics.\n\nBefore deploying the Client Segmentation App app, review the following considerations.\n\nClient Segmentation App is available only in English. Localization is not supported.\nAll users see the same date, time, and number formats, regardless of their locale and language settings.\nMulticurrency is not supported. When Financial Services Cloud extracts your org’s default currency, it uses the currency for monetary values and doesn’t convert to another currency. Labels with the ‘$’ symbol are not converted to reflect the default currency.\nTIP Follow the steps in the order shown to deploy the Client Segmentation App app.\nEnable CRM Analytics\nBefore creating the Client Segmentation App app, enable CRM Analytics in your Salesforce org.\nAssign Client Segmentation App App Administrator Permissions\nEnable administrators to create an app from the Client Segmentation App template and manage it by assigning the Client Segmentation Admin permission set.\nAssign Client Segmentation App User Permissions\nEnable users to view the Client Segmentation App app by assigning the Client Segmentation Analytics User permission set.\nGet Your Data Ready to Create the Client Segmentation App\nData in your org has to meet specific requirements before you can create the Client Segmentation App app.\nSet Field-Level Security to Enable Creation of the Client Segmentation App\nBefore creating the Client Segmentation App app, make sure the Analytics Integration User has access to all fields used in the app.\nCreate and Share an App from the Client Segmentation App Template\nFollow these steps to create and share an app from the Client Segmentation App template.\nSchedule the Data Synch and Dataflow for the Client Segmentation App\nWhen you create the app, the creation process includes a data sync and a dataflow that imports the latest data to CRM Analytics. Schedule the app to refresh every day to ensure that Client Segmentation App uses up-to-date data.\nUnderstand Client Segmentation App Limitations\nThe Client Segmentation app gives you limited access to CRM Analytics capabilities and features.\nSEE ALSO\nUse Financial Services Cloud CRM Analytics Solutions\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
