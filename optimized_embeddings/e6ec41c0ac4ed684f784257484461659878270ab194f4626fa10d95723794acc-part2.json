Out-of-the-box Einstein apps don’t fit your use case, but what if you don’t write code? No problem. Point. Click. Predict!\nConsiderations for Setting Up Einstein Prediction Builder\nBefore you start building predictions, here are a few things to keep in mind.\nUpgrade to the Paid Version of Einstein Prediction Builder\nIf you use the Try Einstein version of Einstein Prediction Builder, you can upgrade to a paid license. Upgrading gets you the full set of features to predict what happens next in your business.\nSet Up Einstein Prediction Builder\nTurn on Einstein Prediction Builder to predict what happens next in your business. Or turn it off if you don’t want to build predictions right now.\nPrediction Data Terminology\nWhen using Einstein Prediction Builder, it’s helpful to understand some terms we use for sets of data.\nPlan Your Prediction\nBefore you start building a prediction, think about what you want to predict and how it translates to Salesforce objects and fields. You must also create a custom field to get your data in a format that Einstein can predict.\nBuild Your Prediction\nWith Einstein Prediction Builder, make custom predictions about what happens next in your business without writing any code. After you decide what you want to predict, the field you want to predict values for, and what object contains that field, you’re ready to build.\nReview Your Prediction’s Scorecard\nAfter your prediction is finished building, review its results in the Einstein Prediction Builder scorecard. Check out big-picture metrics, like prediction quality and top predictors. Drill in on details, such as impact, correlation, and weight of each predictor.\nEnable or Disable a Prediction\nAfter you build a prediction and review its scorecard, you can decide whether to enable it. Your Einstein Prediction Builder license gives you a certain number of total and enabled predictions. Disabling predictions frees up space and saves prediction settings for later use.\nClone, Edit, or Delete a Prediction\nEinstein Prediction Builder lets you clone an existing prediction to create one with different settings. If you want to change only a few settings, editing is the simpler choice. When you no longer need a prediction, delete it.\nTroubleshoot Your Prediction\nWhat if Einstein Prediction Builder gives you no prediction results, or a low-quality prediction? Here are some things to look at.\nPrediction Results on Records\nEinstein Prediction Builder answers questions about the future of your business. How much is the deal likely to be worth? Which customers are likely to renew their subscription? You get answers in the form of scores on records and insights.\nBuild a Managed Package Prediction\nBuild predictions using Einstein Prediction Builder, and bundle them using in a managed package. You can the install and use your predictions in multiple orgs. A managed package makes your custom predictions portable across orgs, and you can bundle with other predictions.\nUse Predictions in Your Workflow\nAfter you build and enable an AI prediction, here's how you can use it in Salesforce.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
