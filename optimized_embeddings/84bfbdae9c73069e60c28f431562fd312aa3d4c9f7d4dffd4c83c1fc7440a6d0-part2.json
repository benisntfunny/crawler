Providing safe banking experiences to customers increases the opportunity to cultivate relationships and deliver products and services in a changed world. Enabling scheduling helps banks assign resources more efficiently and better address customers’ shifting needs. As the world starts to socialize again, an increase in appointment requests is likely to strain resources.\n\nThis solution kit helps you:\n\nEnable customers to self-schedule appointments from your external site.\nAllow appointments by location based on bank capacity, resources, or assets managed.\nSolve for logistics and personalization to deliver efficient, personalized appointments using Salesforce data.\nRequired Products\nOne or more of these clouds:\nFinancial Services Cloud\nSales Cloud\nService Cloud\nIndustries, for example, Health, Manufacturing, Consumer Goods, Work.com, Experience Apps\nSalesforce Scheduler Permission Set License\nOne license per schedulable asset or resource\nSalesforce Scheduler\n\nUse Salesforce Scheduler as the basis for your appointment booking system. Salesforce Scheduler supports location- and capacity-controlled booking use cases. Let customers set appointments with specialized resources, such as a particular retail associate or based on skills needed.\n\nAsset scheduling moves beyond solely resource-booked appointments to provide scheduling based on more complex needs. Allow customers to book based on factors such as bank capacity, private room availability, or in socially distanced time slots for in-bank transactions. Schedule unlimited assets in the same functionality provided for resource-based booking.\n\nGeneral Information\n\nSalesforce Scheduler isn’t available for Platform User license with Resource Schedules.\nSalesforce Scheduler isn’t available for orgs with Field Service installed.\nLightning Experience must be turned on for the org before Salesforce Scheduler can be enabled.\n\nFunctionality Considerations\n\nGuest Site User Inbound Scheduling allows an unauthenticated user to schedule an appointment.\nEnable a Experience Cloud Site or a Salesforce Site.\nIf your scheduling process allows for unauthenticated scheduling, configure the Portal and Organizational Sharing for guest user access.\nExternal Sites using Embedded Services are able to expose the inbound scheduling without authentication of the customer via Lightning Out Apps.\nTo access Salesforce Scheduler, customers must be using a supported web browser.\n\nFlow Builder Considerations\n\nStart from Salesforce Scheduler Standard Flow Template. Configure a personalized experience by enhancing flow templates with Flow Lightning Components or Apex Actions.\n\nUse API or customer components to support use cases where mobile responsiveness and multiple timezone booking requirements are critical. When designing custom API solutions, review templates for workflow considerations.\n\nScheduler flows can be used in Communities and Embedded Services, or they can be extended through custom Lightning Components and APIs.\nTIP To customize standard flow templates, first clone the template from the flow designer.\n\nOutbound Scheduling\n\nInvoke outbound (employee-driven) scheduling flow from account, opportunity, and lead record pages in Salesforce using the Schedule Appointment Lightning Action.\n\nInbound Scheduling\n\nInvoke inbound (customer-driven self-service) scheduling flow.\nAuthenticated customers can schedule and modify appointments in an Experience Cloud site, or externally from a company website. Enable Salesforce Identity to let end-customers authenticate with Salesforce to book and schedule appointments.\n\nGeneral Limits\n\nSalesforce Scheduler limits and limitations apply.\nFor guest users, times are displayed using the site’s default time zone, not the customer’s current time zone.\nImplement This Solution\nWorkflow\nLearn how data flows through the configurations when you schedule banking appointments.\nDesign Considerations\nKeep these design considerations in mind when you schedule banking appointments.\nConfigurations\nUse these configurations to schedule banking appointments.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Scheduler Developer Guide\nCreate and Manage Inbound Appointments in Salesforce Scheduler\nCreate and Manage Outbound Appointments in Salesforce Scheduler\nSet Up Inbound Scheduling\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
