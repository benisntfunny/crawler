The SameSite changes started in February 2020 with the Chrome 80 release, but Google temporarily rolled back the SameSite changes until the summer of 2020. The SameSite changes enhance security and privacy, but require customers and partners to test custom Salesforce integrations that rely on cookies.\n\nThe SameSite attribute on a cookie controls its cross-domain behavior. This Chrome Platform Status explains the intent of the SameSite attribute.\n“SameSite is a reasonably robust defense against some classes of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, but developers currently need to opt in to its protections by specifying a SameSite attribute. In other words, developers are vulnerable to CSRF attacks by default. This change would allow developers to be protected by default, while allowing sites that require state in cross-site requests to opt in to the status quo’s less-secure model.”\n\nIf no SameSite attribute is specified, the Chrome 84 release sets cookies as SameSite=Lax by default. Up until the Chrome 84 release, the default is SameSite=None. After the Chrome 84 release, developers can still opt in to the status quo of unrestricted use by explicitly setting SameSite=None; Secure.\n\nFor more information, see this Chromium blog post.\n\nWhen Will the Chrome SameSite Changes Go Live?\nGoogle's SameSite Updates page indicates that the SameSite changes will coincide with the stable release of Chrome 84 on July 14, 2020, with enforcement enabled for Chrome 80+.\n\nOriginally, Google began rolling out the changes to Chrome 80 Stable for an initial limited population starting the week of February 17, 2020. Google temporarily rolled back the SameSite changes until the summer of 2020 because of the extraordinary global circumstances due to COVID-19.\n\nGoogle stages the stable rollout of Chrome and individual capabilities over time so that any issues can be detected early and addressed before they reach all users. \n\nSalesforce is ready for the SameSite changes whenever Google rolls them out. If you made changes and tested in your org to prepare for Google's initial SameSite rollout in February 2020, you're ready too and there's nothing more for you to do.  If you haven't yet prepared your org for this change, please review the entirety of this article for additional information. \nResolution\nWhat Does This Mean for Me?\nThese SameSite changes by Google Chrome may require you to make changes in your org.\n\n1. Cookies won't work for non-secure (HTTP) browser access, including any community, portal, site, or Outlook or Gmail integration in your org. Use HTTPS instead.\n2. Any custom integrations that rely on cookies might no longer work in Google Chrome. This change particularly affects but is not limited to cross-domain communication, and integrations using iframes.\n\nWhat Do I Need to Do?\n1. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP\nTo require HTTPS access in your org, ensure that the following Session Settings in Setup are enabled. These settings are enabled by default but you should verify that HTTPS is required in your org.\n\nFrom Setup, enter Session Settings in the Quick Find box, then select Session Settings.\n\n    Require secure connections (HTTPS)\nDetermines whether HTTPS is required to log in to or access Salesforce.\nIn Spring ’20, we added the Require Secure HTTPS Connections critical update that requires HTTPS connections to access Salesforce. \n    Require secure connections (HTTPS) for all third-party domains\nDetermines whether HTTPS is required for connecting to third-party domains.\n\nIf either of these settings is disabled, Salesforce may not be fully functional for Chrome users after the Chrome 80 release.\n\nTo require HTTPS access in communities, portals, or sites:\na. From Setup, enter Sites in the Quick Find box, then select Sites.\nb. Click the site you want to edit, and ensure that the Require Secure Connections (HTTPS) checkbox is selected.\n\nTo check whether your Salesforce Classic Canvas connected app works with HTTPS:\na. In Salesforce Classic, from Setup, enter Canvas App Previewer in the Quick Find box, then select Canvas App Previewer.\nb. Click the app that you want to check. If the app loads, it means that the URLs are already set to use HTTPS. If the app doesn’t load in the previewer, update the Canvas App URL and Callback URL to use HTTPS.\n\nTo update your Canvas connected app to HTTPS:\na. In Salesforce Classic, from Setup, enter Create, and then click Apps.\nb. Select the Canvas connected app that you want to update.\nc. In the Canvas App URL field, update the URL to use HTTPS.\nd. In the Callback URL field, update the URL to use HTTPS.\ne. Click Save.\nf. Go back to the Canvas App Previewer and check that the app opens as expected.\nNote: The first time that you navigate to the HTTPS URL, close and reopen tabs and clear your browser history.\n\nUpgrade the LiveMessage Managed Package\nSimilar to other features, LiveMessage (Classic) requires that the Require Secure Connections (HTTPS) and Require secure connections (HTTPS) for all third-party domains Session Settings in Setup are enabled in your org.\n\nThe Chrome 80 release is supported on version 4.46 or later of the managed package. If your org has an older version installed, upgrade to the latest version here.\n\n2. Test custom Salesforce integrations that rely on cookies owned and set by your integration\nBefore the Chrome 84 release, test any custom Salesforce integrations that rely on cookies owned and set by your integration. Test in a sandbox. If you find any regressions, update the SameSite attribute on cookies used for cross-domain communication to explicitly set SameSite=None; Secure. If you set a cookie in Apex, use the new SameSite attribute of the Cookie() constructor method.\n\nThis Chromium blog post explains how to test the effect of the new Chrome behavior on your site or cookies before Chrome rolls out the SameSite changes. Navigate to chrome://flags and enable the “SameSite by default cookies” and “Cookies without SameSite must be secure” experiments. The fixes in Spring '20 apply to Chrome 78 and later.\n\nNote: While you're testing your cookies, consider what's the most secure SameSite value that works for each cookie. If a cookie is intended to be accessed only in a first-party context, you can apply SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Strict to prevent external access. Explicitly setting SameSite=Lax means that you're not relying on default browser behavior.\n\nOnly Chrome 80+ sets SameSite=Lax by default. If you encounter an issue with an integration after the Chrome 80 release, you can temporarily use an unaffected browser, the mobile app, or an older version of Chrome while you implement a fix.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Sales and Service in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic?\nWe support the ongoing effort to improve privacy and security across the web. We updated the SameSite attribute on cookies set by Salesforce. The fixes were made in Spring '20 and apply to Chrome 78 and later.\n\nWe recommend that you test in a sandbox with the latest version of Chrome. We will update this article when any new information emerges.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for B2C Commerce?\nSee the B2C Commerce documentation.\n \nWhat Does This Mean for B2B Commerce?\nSee this knowledge article for B2B Commerce.\n \nWhat Does This Mean for Marketing Cloud?\nSee this knowledge article for Marketing Cloud.\n \nWhat Does This Mean for Pardot Web Tracking?\nSee this knowledge article for Pardot.\n \nWhat Does This Mean for Tableau?\nSee the Tableau knowledge base.\n \nResources\nChromium Blog: Developers: Get Ready for New SameSite=None; Secure Cookie Settings\nChromium Blog: Temporarily rolling back SameSite Cookie Changes\nChrome Platform Status: Cookies default to SameSite=Lax\nChrome Platform Status: Reject insecure SameSite=None cookies\nweb.dev: SameSite cookies explained\ntextslashplain.com: Same-Site Cookies By Default\nietf.org: Incrementally Better Cookies\nKnowledge Article: Microsoft Edge Browser Release 86 Changes SameSite Cookie Behavior and Can Break Salesforce Integrations\nKnowledge Article: Firefox Changes to SameSite Cookie Behavior Can Break Salesforce Integrations\nKnowledge Article Number\n\n000381201\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
