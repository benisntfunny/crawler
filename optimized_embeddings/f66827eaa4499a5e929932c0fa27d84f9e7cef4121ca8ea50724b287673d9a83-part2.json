Many people don't know where to turn when they experience health, housing, personal safety, and other crises that government agencies can assist with. Fortunately, Public Sector Solutions offers care plans, which caseworkers can use to assist constituents in crisis and resolve issues in the community.\n\nCare plans contain goals to help constituents achieve a milestone or outcome, and benefits that help them get there. For a child whose parents are ill or unstable, a care plan can be used to locate a foster home for the child. For a constituent who experiences mobility issues due to an injury, a care plan can provide access to free public transportation, weekly food delivery, or home care assistance.\n\nAmong other things, caseworkers can use care plans to help constituents who are experiencing:\n\nPoverty\nHomelessness\nDisability\nUnemployment\nFood insecurity\nReentry to the community after serving time in prison\n\nOftentimes, the need for a care plan arises when a constituent other than the person who needs help contacts a government agency. For example, a constituent sees their elderly neighbor driving erratically and is concerned for their health and wellbeing. In Public Sector Solutions, you can create care plans for cases related to these reports, which are stored as public complaint records. And either you as a Public Sector Solutions administrator, or a case manager to whom you assign permissions, can create care plan templates for different assistance scenarios. When a caseworker investigates the issue or concern, they can create a care plan based on a template, and customize it for each individual case. You can also create individual, one-off care plans for any case as needed. This documentation focuses on how to set up and use care plan templates with cases created based on public complaints. Create care plan templates that include goals and benefits for different assistance scenarios.\n\nTo use care plans, an intake officer creates the public complaint record, and then a case manager creates and prioritizes a case to investigate the concern. The caseworker takes over from there, conducting a dynamic assessment and creating a care plan for the case based on the appropriate care plan template.\n\nCreate a Care Plan Template\nInclude benefits and goals in a care plan template so that you can easily reuse the items to connect constituents with standard types of services and support.\nAdd the Care Plan Related List to the Case Page Layout\nMake it easy for intake officers and others to access care plans for the cases they manage.\nAdd Custom Fields to a Care Plan Guided Flow\nBuild care plans tailored to your needs by adding custom fields.\nCreate Tasks for Care Plans with Action Plan Templates\nHelp keep case participants accountable and on track by adding tasks to the benefits and goals in a care plan.\nGive Caseworkers Access to Goal Assignments and Benefit Assignments Related to Care Plans\nAllow caseworkers to effectively collaborate on cases by granting them access to goal assignment and benefit assignment records related to care plans.\nCreate a Care Plan for a Case\nCreate custom care plans based on care plan templates to help your constituents reach their specific goals.\nUse a Flow to Enroll Participants in Benefit Sessions from Care Plans\nAdd participants to individual benefit sessions according to their availability and preferences.\nTrack Attendance and Disbursements for Benefit Participants\nAssess the effectiveness of a program or care plan by recording and tracking attendance.\nView and Manage Care Plans\nKeep care plans current so that they stay relevant to you and to your constituents.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
