You can customize the default scoring rules and decide how engagement and fit scores factor into the overall marketing score for a lead or contact. Use the engagement, fit, and overall marketing scores to build segments and create targeted content.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\n\nFor an overview of scoring in Marketing Cloud, check out this video.\n\nAdd a Scoring Component to a Record Page\n\nAn admin can add the Data Cloud Profile Insights component to lead and contact record pages in the Lightning App Builder. Add the component for each score that you want to display: Overall Marketing Score, Marketing Engagement Score, and Marketing Fit Score. See Page Customization in Marketing Cloud Growth.\n\nShare Scores with Your Sales Team\n\nAfter you make scoring components available, let your sales team know. Sales teams can use lead scores to help decide which leads are the most likely to convert and which have the highest potential value.\n\nUse Scores to Create a Segment\n\nTarget audiences more precisely by including scores in your marketing segments. For example, create a segment of people you know are likely to engage with your content, and target them with specific content. You can also use scores to target people who aren’t engaged but are a good fit for your business. Send them content to encourage engagement, such as a promo code or special event invite. See Target Audience with Marketing Cloud Growth.\n\nConsiderations for People Scoring in Marketing Cloud Growth\nWhen working with scoring in Marketing Cloud Growth, keep these considerations in mind.\nDefault Scoring System in Marketing Cloud Growth\nLeads and contacts are scored based on the rules that you publish. You can use the default rules for both engagement and fit, or you can customize them to fit your needs.\nAvailable Attributes for Engagement Scoring Rules\nWhen you configure scoring rules, you can use data from the attributes available for each of the engagement objects: Email Engagement, Message Engagement, and Website Engagement. Use this reference to supply the correct value for standard attributes commonly used in scoring.\nConfigure Scoring Rules in Marketing Cloud Growth\nTo begin scoring leads and contacts, select a unified individual object to score on. Then, customize scoring rules for engagement and fit. You can use the default scoring rules or edit them. You can also add or delete rules.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
