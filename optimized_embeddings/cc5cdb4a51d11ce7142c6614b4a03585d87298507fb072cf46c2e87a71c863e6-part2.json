Capture the time frame during which the lead is interested in the transaction and the items that they’re interested in. You can also capture information about the account that provided the lead, and the lead’s preferred dealers. When the lead gets converted into an opportunity, the granular information is retained and available for dealers right through the lifecycle of an opportunity. The Leads tab on the Dealer Performance dashboard in the CRM Analytics app provides insight about lead conversion rates and lead pipeline by region and period.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\n\nWith Lead Line Items, OEMs and dealers can track the products that the customer is interested in, the type of transaction such as buying or selling, the condition, and classification of the vehicle or parts, the unit price of the product and other details. You can capture details not just for new vehicles and parts but also for used or refurbished cars. You can also capture the price type and finance details for each lead item.\n\nYou can use Lead Preferred Sellers to know the dealers of choice for a customer and the agencies or accounts that provided the leads.\n\nWhen a lead gets converted to an opportunity, Lead Line Items and Lead Preferred Sellers also get converted into Opportunity Products and Opportunity Preferred Sellers. Finding this information from lead creation to opportunity closure improves customer and dealer experiences. OEMs can capture and route their qualified leads to the right dealers quickly while helping dealers maintain consistent and timely communication.\n\nCapture Granular Details About Automotive Leads\nCapture all the information that leads—prospective customers—typically convey, such as the period during which they're interested in a business transaction, and the type of products and services they’re interested in. You can also capture the lead’s preferred dealers and the source that provided the lead. Leads can be sourced organically from a company’s website, from events and product launches, and via referrals. Leads can also be sourced from lead generation companies or digital marketing agencies who share high-quality leads with automotive companies. You can relate the lead provider account with a lead to understand the source of the lead. When a lead is converted into an opportunity, providing dealers visibility into the lead’s preferred products and sellers greatly enhances the sales process.\nConvert Leads Into Opportunities and Distribute with Dealers\nExpand your customer pipeline by successfully qualifying and converting leads into opportunities. With automatic conversion of lead products and lead preferred sellers to opportunity products and opportunity preferred sellers, retain key information about a prospect’s preferences until a deal is finalized. If a sales rep knows which dealership or products the customer is interested in, the rep can base their sales efforts and engagements on the information. OEMs can also assess the quality of leads better at the opportunity stage if they know which sources provided a specific lead. OEMs can match leads with preferred dealer groups and share the lead information. While most OEMs distribute leads with dealer groups, some OEMs convert leads themselves and distribute opportunity records with dealer groups.\nLead and Opportunity Conversion Predictions by Using Scoring Framework\nUse Scoring Framework to get predictions about leads that are likely to convert to opportunities or accounts and about opportunities that are likely to convert to accounts.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
