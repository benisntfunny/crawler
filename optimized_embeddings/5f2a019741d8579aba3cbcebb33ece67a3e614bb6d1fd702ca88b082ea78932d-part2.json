You get multiple dashboards, over 100 reports, and even custom report types. Use the dashboards to monitor and manage Chatter adoption and engagement in your organization.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance Editions\n\nUse the Salesforce Chatter Dashboards package to:\n\nView overall Chatter adoption with detailed metrics and monthly trends\nMonitor group adoption with membership and engagement metrics, such as the number of posts, comments, likes, and the top contributors\nMonitor content creation and user engagement, such as the top files, trending content, and the top contributors\nView topic taxonomy and monitor topic assignments, including the most assigned topics and the top assigners\nCreate customized reports using existing groupings such as department, country, role, or profile\n\nYou can install the Salesforce Chatter Dashboards from AppExchange.\n\nTIP For installation instructions, detailed information about the reports, and upgrade instructions, see Get Started with Chatter Dashboards.\n\nAfter the package is installed, you can access your new dashboards, reports, and custom report types alongside all your other Salesforce dashboards and reports.\n\nAs newer versions of the package become available, you can upgrade your package by reinstalling it.
