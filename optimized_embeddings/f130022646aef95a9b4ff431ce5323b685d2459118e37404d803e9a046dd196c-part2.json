To use biometric ID credentials, your device must have a device passcode or PIN enabled and FaceID (for iOS) or Android Security and Privacy | Biometrics.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nSetup for Mobile Publisher available in: Lightning Experience\nSetup for Mobile Publisher available in: production only (not sandbox)\nAvailable in Lightning Experience in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create and modify a Mobile Publisher project:\tManage mySalesforce Apps\n\nMobile Publisher apps support biometric ID app unlock using face or fingerprint credentials when the biometric authentication method is available on the Android or iOS device. Depending on the mobile device, Mobile Publisher also supports Swipe and PIN unlock.\n\nWhen you enable biometric ID app unlock, users are prompted for their biometric credentials when they open the app with a cold start. A cold start is when the user opens the app for the first time or opens the app after closing the app entirely (swiping up to quit the app). If the user has no security settings enabled, they’re forced to log out of the app.\n\nIMPORTANT Remember to wrap attribute values in quotation marks.\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Manage Connected Apps, and then select Manage Connected Apps.\nSelect the connected app that you want to enable biometric ID unlock for.\nIn the Custom Attributes section, click New.\nFor the attribute key, enter ENABLE_BIOMETRICS_UNLOCK. For the attribute value, enter “TRUE”.\nSave your changes.\n\nAfter you enable biometric ID app unlock, your app users must configure their devices to enable unlocking apps with biometric ID credentials in order to use this login method.\n\nIf Android app users don’t configure their biometric ID credentials, they’re prompted to proceed with one of these options: log out, log in on a browser, log in with a passcode, or to open their device’s settings.\n\nIf iOS app users don’t configure their biometric ID credentials, they’re prompted to log in with a passcode. If the iOS app user doesn't have biometric ID app unlock or passcode unlock configured on their device, the user is prompted to enable a passcode.\n\nSet Time Value for Biometric Login\nBy default, users must reenter biometric ID credentials when the app is in the background for more than 15 minutes. You can set your own time value requirement by adding a custom attribute.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
