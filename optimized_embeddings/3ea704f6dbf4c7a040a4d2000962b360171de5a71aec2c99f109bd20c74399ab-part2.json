Also use it to specify the type of test or vaccination combinations required for generating a QR code URL and adding it to the Health Verification record.\n\nEvery time a user submits a form for Health Verification, Safety Cloud creates a Health Verification record. Safety Cloud compares information from the Health Verification record against the Occasion Access Settings to determine whether to generate a QR code that grants the user access to an event.\n\nOccasion Access settings determine which Health Verification records trigger QR code generation and for how long the QR code remains valid. The time for which a QR code remains valid is formulated by a fixed date range or by an offset from the current date/time in minutes.\n\nOccasion Access Settings work on form-based Health Verification records and Health Verification records from third-party integrations.\n\nTo create the Access Settings for an Occasion, complete these steps.\n\nFrom the Occasion object, click Related.\nFrom the Occasion Access Settings section, click New.\nEnter an Occasion Access Setting Name. For example, Conference 3 day access.\nEnter a Health Verification Method.\n\nThe Health Verification method must correspond to a Health Verification Method in your Occasion Settings.\n\nEnter a Verification Status. For example, Verified.\nIn the Verification Datetime field, enter safetycloud__TestDateTime_c.\nSet a date time range for QR code generation in the Verification Datetime Range Start and Verification Datetime Range fields.\nThe values that you specify in these two fields determine the window of time where the Health Verification record is considered for QR code generation.\nSet a datetime range or a time in minutes for which the generated QR code remains valid.\n\nTo set the time range for which the generated QR code remains valid, you can use the Access Offset field or the Access Start Datetime and Access End Datetime fields. You can’t use both.\n\nThe Access Offset is represented in minutes. Consider using Access Offset for situations where access is required for a short time and is initiated as soon as the user’s health status is verified. For example, you can use the Access Offset for an Amazon delivery driver who needs access to your site for 30 minutes.\n\nSave your changes.\nSEE ALSO\nCreate an Occasion\nCreate an Occasion Setting\nSet up a Digital Experience Site with the Health Verification Form\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
