Understand what each status means and how it relates to your marketing campaigns and flows.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\n\nTo find the status of a content item, check the Status column in your marketing workspace or the Details card on the content detail page.\n\nDraft\n\nDraft indicates that the content either hasn’t been published or has been unpublished. When content is in draft status, you can edit it and relate it to campaigns, flows, or other content items. You can also preview or test the content. Draft content is visible only to contributors in the marketing workspace. Customers can’t see or access content in draft status.\n\nPublished\n\nPublished indicates that the content is available in your channels and ready to use in a campaign. When content is published, you can continue to associate it with campaigns, flows, or content. You can also preview or test the content. When you edit published content, a new content version is created, and the status changes to revised.\n\nPublishing doesn’t immediately make the content available to external customers. Here’s what the published status means for each content type.\n\nCONTENT TYPE\tWHAT PUBLISHED MEANS\nEmail\t\n\nThe email is ready to send in a messaging campaign flow.\n\nYour customers can’t see the email until the campaign or flow is activated.\n\n\nSMS Message\t\n\nThe SMS message is ready to send in a messaging campaign flow.\n\nYour customers can’t see the SMS message until the flow is activated.\n\n\nLanding Page\t\n\nThe landing page is ready to be made publicly available as part of a campaign flow.\n\nWhen you publish a landing page that contains a form, the form is published, and the flow associated with the form is activated.\n\nPublishing the landing page activates any URL aliases that aren’t already active.\n\n\nForm\t\n\nThe form is ready for user input, and the associated campaign flow is activated.\n\nYour customers can’t see the form until it’s added to a landing page, which must be published and have an active URL alias. See Create and Publish a Form in Marketing Cloud.\n\n\nImage\t\n\nThe image is ready to associate with individual content items. If an unpublished image is attached to another content item and you publish that content item, the image is also published.\n\n\nBrand\t\n\nThe brand is ready to associate with a content item. If an unpublished brand is attached to an email or landing page and you publish the content, the brand is also published. See Brand Your Content in Marketing Cloud Growth.\n\nRevised\n\nRevised indicates published content versions that have unpublished edits. When you edit published content, the status on the content item updates to revised. The original published content remains available in your campaigns and related content items. Similar to draft content, revised content is visible only to contributors in the marketing workspace.\n\nEXAMPLE Your email campaign includes a published email. When you edit the email content, the original email in your campaign doesn’t change. Later, when you publish the revised email version, you see the status update to Published, and then the email is updated in your campaign.\nScheduled Publish or Unpublish\n\nAfter you schedule content to publish or unpublish, the content remains in the current status until the date and time that you scheduled. You can monitor the schedule in the Publication Activity tab on a content detail page.\n\nSEE ALSO\nView CMS Content Details in Enhanced CMS Workspaces\nCreate Publication Schedules in Salesforce CMS\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
