In such cases, agents can route the user’s health verification record to a Needs Review queue for further analysis by designated agents or supervisors.\n\nWhen you deploy the Health Verification package to your org, we create two public groups for agents automatically.\n\nHealth Verification Tier 1 Agents\nHealth Verification Tier 2 Agents\n\nThese groups are assigned to queues automatically as follows:\n\nTier 1 and Tier 2 groups are assigned to the Health Verification queue.\nThe Tier 2 group is assigned to the Health Verification Needs Review queue.\n\nAs an admin, you can add agents to either of these public groups. Agents assigned to the Health Verification Tier 2 Agents have access to the Needs Review queue.\n\nHealth Verification records are routed to the Needs Review queue automatically when a user clicks the Unable to Verify button when filling out the health verification field, or when an agent clicks the Request Review quick action from a user’s health verification form.\n\nTo assign agents to their respective group, complete these steps.\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Public Groups, select Health Verification Tier 1 Agents or Health Verification Tier 2 Agents, and then click Edit.\nSet the Search field to Users, enter the Agent’s name, and click Find.\nTo add agents to the group you selected, select the agent name from the Available Members list box, and click Add.\n\nThe agent’s name is moved to the Selected Members list box.\n\nWhen you’re done assigning agents to the group, save your changes.\nSEE ALSO\nAssign a Permission Set to Multiple Users\nEnable Path\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
