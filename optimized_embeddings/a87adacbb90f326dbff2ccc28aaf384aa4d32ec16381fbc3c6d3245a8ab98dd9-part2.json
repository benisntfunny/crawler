The Health Verification package uses the cache to improve the performance of status look-ups. Depending on your data volume, usage patterns, and performance requirements, you can allocate more space to the cache org partition.\nCreate Consent Records with an Apex Job for Customer Health Verification Form\nWith a scheduled Apex job, you can regularly create consent records for the COVID-19 health verifications that are generated after a customer completes the COVID-19 health verification form.
