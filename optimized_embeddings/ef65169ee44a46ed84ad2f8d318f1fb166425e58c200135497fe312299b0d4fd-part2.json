You can request a 10-digit long code in the United States. You can also request a new US or Canadian short code or port an existing short code into your account. 10-digit long codes require an associated brand and campaign in order to send messages. You can’t port an existing 10-digit long code. US and Canadian short codes don’t require associated brands or campaigns.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nUnified Messaging for WhatsApp is available in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions for Marketing Cloud Engagement and Service Cloud Digital Engagement\nUnified Messaging for Email and SMS is available in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions for Marketing Cloud Growth\nNot supported in Government Cloud Plus\nRequest a Brand for a United States 10-Digit Code\nYou can request one brand per purchased 10-digit long code.

All keywords are case-insensitive.\nSMS Engagement Data in Unified Messaging\nUnified Messaging captures SMS engagement data in a data model object (DMO) in Data Cloud. Every send or interaction with your SMS messaging activities generates this data. You can use these fields to segment audiences or populate reports on your messaging activities.\nCreate a Branded Domain for Unified Messaging\nUse a branded domain to shorten URLs to personalized links. You can then use shortened text in SMS messages and use the links to track interactions.
