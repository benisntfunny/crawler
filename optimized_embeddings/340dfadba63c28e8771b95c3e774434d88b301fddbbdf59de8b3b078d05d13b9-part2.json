Follow our troubleshooting tips to help your team reach their sales goals.\n\nProblem: You’re Not Winning Deals\n\nA dip in your won opportunities, or won deals, can influence your overall sales.\n\nBefore you jump to conclusions, do a little research.\n\nAsk your team how the personalize their pitches to each prospect. Unless they’re well-versed in what their prospect does and what they care about, they’re missing an opportunity to delight them.\nCheck if market conditions that are influencing your business.\nCheck whether team members struggle to close their won opportunities. It might be a good time to update your training and materials.\nMake sure that your sales process is solid. Your team can have trouble keeping up with the steps to get their deals to the finish line.\nProblem: Some of Your Teammates Don’t Perform as Well as Others\n\nA down trend in individual performance can be due to several factors.\n\nFor a small dip (under 5% for the month), make minor adjustments.\n\nSee if sales decreased across the team or for individuals. A top performer may be burned out or having a hard time.\nLook for external factors such as a product issue, service issue, or change in your competitors.\nImprove your team training and provide more management reviews to provide continuous feedback and help the team maximize sales.\n\nA larger drop in performance (somewhere between 5-10% for the month), indicates that it’s a good time to bolster your sales team.\n\nIs your team in a rut? Help them find ways to freshen up or innovate their sales techniques.\nPrepare your team to give dynamic presentations and pitch to prospects anytime, anywhere so they don’t miss opportunities. Save presentation slides, fact sheets, and other materials in a public folder and block off time for your team to practice their pitch.\nDo you have enough headcount? If your small team is overworked or your teammates are playing too many roles, their sales can suffer.\n\nIf the drop in performance could be related to high staff turnover, focus on building loyalty and retention.\n\nTry improving your new-hire training and implementing team feedback. New-hire training can be the positive first impression that builds loyalty and excitement in your growing team.\nKeep employees happy with programs like in-office perks, performance-based bonuses, and other incentives.\nConduct an anonymous survey, lead a listening tour, or hire outside help to figure out why people leave.\nProblem: Sales Are Getting Smaller\n\nSometimes your wins are high, but revenue per win declines.\n\nWhen you notice a dip in your team’s average sale size, you can make a few adjustments.\n\nOptimize your average price or SKU to give your customers more value.\nRevise your average list price or discounts.\nCoordinate sales efforts across your entire team to increase deal sizes.\n\nIf your average sale size is down significantly, focus on ways to increase sales size.\n\nCan your team clearly articulate the value your company brings when qualifying customers? Help them achieve this to make your customers more receptive to your message and to reduce price pushback.\nConsider bundling products.\nFocus your team’s efforts on target opportunities that they can win.\nProblem: Your Team Is Losing More Deals Than They’re Winning\n\nIt can be discouraging to see more losses than wins in a month. Before you take it to heart, check on your process and customer relationships.\n\nIf you’re losing opportunities, take a look at your sales process.\n\nTrack which competitors are winning your prospective customers. Bonus points if you can also capture why.\nMake sure that your process includes dropping weak opportunities quickly so your team can focus on promising deals.\n\nTake the opportunity to strengthen relationships with your current customers. If you prioritize revenue generation over customer service, your current relationships may suffer. Customer loyalty leads to continued support.\n\nWhen your win rate needs a bigger boost, it’s time to listen to your customers.\n\nConsider appointing a customer advisory board to help you understand and respond to what creates value for your customers.\nImplement a referral program for your existing customers to help you connect with the right decision-makers at new companies.\nProblem: New Opportunities Are Scarce\n\nIt’s hard to find that sweet spot of having a few deals on the table without spreading your team too thin.\n\nWith a small decrease in opportunity volume, figure out why and nip it in the bud.\n\nLook for any external factors that caused your team to focus on fewer opportunities.\nMake sure that your team employs the right narrative and provides valuable insights on their first contact with prospects. If they don’t spend enough time on the phone, they might not be making a strong impact with leads and prospects.\n\nFor a significant decrease in opportunity volume, keep digging.\n\nCheck if your sales are dropping. Fewer opportunities in the mix could be the culprit.\nHelp your team employ a variety of methods to break through to prospects, and equip them with your own data to leverage as they acquire new customers.\n\nKeep in mind, too, that fewer opportunities can be due to fewer leads to qualify. Check on the health of your sales pipeline, from marketing and lead generation to closing deals.\n\nProblem: Your Team Is Taking Too Long to Close Deals\n\nWhen you leave a deal in limbo, you leave money on the table.\n\nIf your team takes a little longer than usual to close their open deals, figure out why.\n\nCheck for issues with your sales stages. If your stages don’t accurately reflect your team’s workflow, your teammates could be struggling to track their efforts.\nMake sure that your team might is closing their deals in Salesforce as soon as the details are hammered out.\nImplement consistent reviews of your sales pipeline and momentum. Help them to review and improve their processes.\n\nA big increase in days to close can mean that your longer sales period contributes to a decline in closed won opportunities and total sales.\n\nAvoid complicating your sales process and look for ways to decrease the number of stages or the number of days per stage.\nSchedule regular reviews of stalled opportunities and support your team as they resolve their challenges.\nProblem: Your Team Is Entering Data Incorrectly\n\nHeads up! When any metric changes considerably, it’s likely a data-quality problem. Your sales could be better than they look.\n\nIf you suspect a data-quality problem, make sure that everyone on your team is entering and classifying opportunities in the same way and on time. Double-check your field mappings and filters so that your reports and dashboards properly display the information you need.\n\nIf you’re still stumped, you can always contact us for help. Our business and success coaches are happy to help you figure out what’s going wrong.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
