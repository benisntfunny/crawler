Then, change the home page to one of the Visualforce pages included in the Vaccine Eligibility package and set up public access to the form.\n\nFirst, let’s create everything you need to get started.\n\nEnable Digital Experiences and register a domain.\nThe domain should be in the format YOURSITE-community/force.com. For detailed steps, see Enable Digital Experiences.\nCreate a new Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce Community. Don’t activate it yet.\nMake sure that an Experience Cloud site was created with your domain.\nSet up a custom domain to serve your site.\nWe recommend that you use the Salesforce CDN to serve your custom domain.\nWhen you add a custom URL, enter / to create a root path for your domain.\n\nChange the home page of your site to one of the Visualforce pages included in the package, then set access.\n\nGo to Setup | User Interface | Sites and Domains | Sites.\nClick the site label of your Experience Cloud site. (The site type is Community.)\nClick Edit.\nUnder Active Site Home Page, use the lookup to find the page you want to use as the home page.\nFor the Vaccine Eligibility packages, use Vaccination Sign-Up Start Page.\nMake sure that the following settings are selected:\nRequire secure connections (HTTPS)\nUpgrade all requests to HTTPS\nClick Save.\nClick Public Access Settings.\nOn Enabled Visualforce Page Access, click Edit.\nAdd every page that begins with vaxpk.\nClick Save.\nOn Enabled Apex Class Access, click Edit.\nAdd the following controller.\nFor Vaccine Eligibility packages, add vaxpk.PreRegUserInputController.\nClick Save.\nActivate your site.\nGo to Setup | Digital Experiences | All Sites.\nClick Workspace next to the Tabs + Visualforce Community you created in step 2.\nClick Activate.\nYour site’s content is published on your custom domain and URL.\nPreview your site.\nGo to Setup | User Interface | Sites and Domains | Domains.\nClick the name of your custom URL.\nClick View next to the root path.\nNOTE If you made any changes to the Visualforce pages, preview your site with the Experience Cloud site URL instead. It can take some time for changes to appear from your external domain.\n\nTo protect your sign-up form against bots, we strongly encourage you to implement a captcha solution for your registration form. Learn More\n\nKeep in mind that any server-side processing that you introduce with your recaptcha implementation impacts the performance of the form. Notify Salesforce before performing any load or scale testing in production.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
