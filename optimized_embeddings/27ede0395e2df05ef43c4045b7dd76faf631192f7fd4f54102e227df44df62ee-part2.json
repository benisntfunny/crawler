Named credentials specify the URL of a callout endpoint and its required authentication parameters for third-party integrations in one definition.\n\nFor example, Safety Cloud can use RainFocus to manage the event registration, Marketing Cloud Engagement to send confirmation and status update emails, and Senneca for COVID-19 testing services.\n\nTo set up the service integrations, an admin updates the Auth Provider record with authentication property values from the third party. For example, the admin updates the Auth Provider record with the Auth Provider Id, Consumer Key/Secret, and Endpoint URL from the third party.\n\nIf you plan on using third-party services for COVID-19 testing or event registration, you must enter your organization’s credentials to connect to those services.\n\nComplete these steps to create Auth Providers and named credentials.\n\nTo create Auth Providers:\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Auth. Providers, and then select Auth. Providers.\nClick New, and then select Salesforce for the Provider Type.\nClick Save, and then fill out the form with authentication property values from the third party.\nSave your work.\nTo create named credentials:\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Named Credentials, and then select Named Credentials.\nClick New Named Credential, and then fill out the page with the callout endpoint’s URL and authentication parameters.\nSave your work.\nEXAMPLE\nSenneca Username and Password Example\nLabel: Senneca API\nName: Senneca_API\nURL: [URL for the Senneca External System]\nIdentity Type: Named Principal\nAuthentication Protocol: Password Authentication\nUsername: [Your Integration Username]\nPassword: [Your Integration Password]\nGenerate Authorization Header: No\nAllow Merge Fields in HTTP Header: Yes\nAllow Merge Fields in HTTP Body: Yes\nRainFocus Username and Password Example\nLabel: Rainfocus API\nName: Rainfocus_API\nURL: https://events.rainfocus.com\nIdentity Type: Named Principal\nAuthentication Protocol: Password Authentication\nUsername: [Your Integration Username]\nPassword: [Your Integration Password]\nGenerate Authorization Header: Yes\nAllow Merge Fields in HTTP Header: Yes\nAllow Merge Fields in HTTP Body: Yes\nCvent OAuth 2.0 Example\nLabel: Cvent API\nName: Cvent_API\nURL: https://api-platform-sandbox.cvent.com/ea\nIdentity Type: Named Principal\nAuthentication Protocol: OAuth 2.0\nAuthentication Provider: [Lookup to Auth.
