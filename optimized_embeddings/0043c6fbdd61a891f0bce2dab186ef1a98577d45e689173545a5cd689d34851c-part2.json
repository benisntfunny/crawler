You can then promote individual work items to the first pipeline stage.\n\nTo ensure DevOps Center can process all the changes during the promotion, follow these guidelines to avoid promotion errors.\n\nLimit the total number of work items to approximately 50 or fewer in each non-bundled pipeline stage.\nWhen promoting work items from the Approved Work Items list, select up to 20 work items at a time.\nWhen promoting work items from a non-bundled pipeline stage, up to 30 work items at a time.\nClick Pipeline.\nUnder Approved Work Items, select the work items to promote to the next stage.\nClick Promote Selected.\nIf you haven’t logged in to the environment for the next pipeline stage from within DevOps Center, complete the login process, then reselect the items to promote and click Promote Selected.\nIn the Promotion Options dialog, select a promotion option and which Apex tests to run.\nClick Promote.\n\nIf DevOps Center doesn’t detect any conflicts or shared components, the selected work items are merged and deployed to the environment associated with the next stage.\n\n(Optional) If DevOps Center detects a dependency or shared components for the selected work items, DevOps Center provides you with the option to combine the work items to address the conflict.\n\nProceed by choosing one of these options:\n\nCombine the work items.\n\nFor either shared components or a dependency, combine the work items. DevOps Center uses the latest versions of the conflicting components. See Prevent Potential Conflicts By Combining Work Items. Combining work items merges all changes into one feature branch so you avoid downstream merge conflicts.\n\nAttempt to promote the originally selected work items.\n\nIf shared components are detected, promote the selected work items. However, it’s likely that the other work items, which you don’t choose to promote, still contain conflicts. The promotion is blocked until you manually fix the conflict in the source control system. See Review and Resolve Conflicts in GitHub.\n\nPromote the work item even though there’s a dependency with another work item.\n\nIf the promotion is blocked, promote the dependent work item at a later time. However, it’s likely that the other work items still have conflicts. The promotion is blocked until you manually fix the conflict in the source control system. See Review and Resolve Conflicts in GitHub.\n\nSEE ALSO\nPromotion Options\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
