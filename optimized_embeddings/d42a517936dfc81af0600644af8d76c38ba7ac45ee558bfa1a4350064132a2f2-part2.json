This code is mapped to a Salesforce result code.\nGateway Result Code Description\tThe description of the gateway result code.\nIP Address\tThe IP address of the user who initiated the payment.\nMAC Address\tThe MAC address of the user who initiated the payment.\nOrder Payment Summary\tThe order payment summary associated with the payment authorization.\nPayment Authorization Number\tThe auto-generated ID number of the payment authorization.\nPayment Gateway\tThe payment gateway that processed the payment authorization.\nPayment Group\tThe payment group associated with the payment.\nPayment Method\tThe payment method used by the customer to make the payment.\nPhone\tThe phone number of the customer who made the payment.\nProcessing Mode\t\n\nIndicates whether the payment adjustment was made outside of the Salesforce platform.\n\nPossible values are:\n\nExternal—The transaction occurred outside of the Salesforce payment platform.\nSalesforce—Salesforce made and recorded an external call to the payment gateway.\n\nSalesforce Result Code\t\n\nThe Salesforce result code for the payment transaction. This value can be mapped to one or more gateway result codes.\n\nPossible values are:\n\nDecline—The gateway call failed, but it may still work if the transaction is attempted again. For example, the customer had insufficient funds or briefly lost their connection.\nIndeterminate—The gateway didn’t respond to the call. This response usually happens when Salesforce times out while waiting for a response from the gateway.\nPermanent Fail: The gateway call failed and won’t work even if tried again.

For example, Salesforce lost credentials or access to its server. Salesforce ends payment calls if it doesn’t receive a response from the gateway within two minutes.\nValidation Error—Customer payment data was incorrect. For example, the payment was submitted with a misspelling in the credit card address or an incorrect CVV.\n\nStatus\t\n\nIndicates the status of the payment transaction.\n\nPossible values are:\n\nCanceled—The payment has been voided and can no longer be allocated.\nDraft—The payment can be edited before posting it and allocating it to a target.\nFailed—The authorization for the payment failed.\nProcessed—The payment has been finalized and can be allocated against a target.\n\nTotal Payment Auth Reversal Amount\tThe total amount of authorized payments that have been reversed.\nTotal Payment Capture Amount\tThe total amount of authorized payments that have been captured.\nSEE ALSO\nOrder Management Objects and Fields\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
