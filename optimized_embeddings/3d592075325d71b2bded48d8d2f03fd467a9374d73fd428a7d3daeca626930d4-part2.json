Users who follow a record, see those updates in their view of What I Follow, with one exception. Updates users make themselves aren’t posted to What I Follow. Users can see those updates in their profile feeds.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience\n\n\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Contact Manager, Developer, and Database.com Editions\n\nThe Account, Case, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and User objects aren’t available in Database.com.\n\nSalesforce Connect external objects are available in Developer Edition and, for an extra cost, in Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions.\n\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo select the fields to track:\t“Customize Application”\nTo view the field tracking setup page:\t“View Setup and Configuration”\n\nFeed tracking is available for record fields. You can configure feed tracking for users, Chatter groups, topics, custom objects, external objects, and the following standard objects: accounts, knowledge articles, assets, campaigns, cases, contacts, contracts, dashboards, events, leads, opportunities, products, reports, solutions, and tasks.\n\nIMPORTANT In Lightning Experience, most object records don't show a Chatter tab unless Feed Tracking is enabled for the object. Exceptions include Group, Site, and User objects.\n\nSharing rules and field-level security determine the visibility of record changes in Chatter feeds. To see changes to a record in their feeds, users must have access to the record.\n\nThese objects and fields are tracked by default.\n\nAccount: Account Name, Account Owner\nCase: Case Owner, Priority, Status\nChatter Group: Allow Customers, Description, Group Access, Information Body, Information Title, Name, Owner Name\nContact: Account Name, Contact Owner, Name\nLead: Lead Owner, Lead Status, Name\nOpportunity: Amount, Close Date, Opportunity Name, Opportunity Owner, Stage\nTopic: Description\nUser: About Me, Address, Email, Manager, Phone, Title\n\nTracked feed updates that are older than 45 days and have no likes or comments are deleted automatically. The tracked feed updates no longer appear in the feed. However, if auditing is enabled for a tracked field, the tracking field audit history is still available.\n\nReports on feed activities don’t include information about system-generated posts.\n\nTracked changes in a feed can be bundled together for quick and easy reading. This image shows two change notifications bundled together. On this record, Bat Chad changed the values for the Product Owner and QA Engineer fields.\n\nCustomize Chatter Feed Tracking\nWhen you enable feed tracking for objects and records, users see updates for the objects and records that they follow in their What I Follow feed. Many objects and fields are tracked by default, but you can further customize feed tracking to include or exclude specific objects and fields.\nFeed Tracking Limitations\nHere are some limitations on tracking objects, fields, and topics.\nFeed Tracked Change Bundles\nWe save you time and space in your feeds by bundling multiple feed tracked change updates into a quick-reference list. Bundles are collections of feed tracked change items that you see in feeds. You can see bundles in your browser. In Salesforce for Android and Salesforce for iOS, bundles appear only in record feeds.\nSEE ALSO\nChatter Settings\nFeed Tracked Change Bundles\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
