Some restrictions apply. For pricing details, contact your Salesforce account executive.\n\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create and save Lightning pages in the Lightning App Builder:\tCustomize Application\n\nTo create custom Lightning pages, head over to the Lightning App Builder. When you’re done customizing your Lightning page, assign the page to your console app.\n\nNOTE In Lightning Experience, you control the appearance of your components differently than in Salesforce Classic.\nSize—The page template for your record page determines the size of the component region. For example, the Three Regions page template provides a main region width of 50%, and the side region widths are each 25%. When you drag a component to a side region, its size is 25% of the screen’s width. To view the available page templates, create a page in the Lightning App Builder.\nPresentation—To stack components, drag components onto a page region. To use tabs, first drag the Tabs component onto the page, then drag components into the individual tabs. To group components in collapsible sections, drag the Accordion component onto the page, then add components into each section.\n\nThe following templates and components are useful in Lightning console apps.\n\nRecord Page Templates\n\nThe Three Regions template and the pinned region templates are designed with Lightning console apps in mind. They feature a main region and two sidebars with fixed proportional widths. The main region is 50%, and the side region widths are each 25%. Three-region templates require more screen width to display correctly. Three-region templates can display incorrectly on certain devices or monitors with low resolutions.\n\nUse the console pinned region templates to let your console users view and work with records while navigating between subtabs. You can create record pages using one of the following pinned region templates:\n\nPinned Header\nPinned Header and Left Sidebar\nPinned Left Sidebar\nPinned Left and Right Sidebars\nPinned Right Sidebar (3 regions)\nNOTE Pinned regions don’t support theming. For example, if you use custom theming to brand your app with the color green, the pinned region doesn’t apply the green color.\nLightning Components\n\nThese components are useful in Lightning console apps.\n\nAccordion\nThis component organizes your components into collapsible sections. You can have up to 25 sections, but we recommend no more than 10. You can put multiple components in each section and customize the heading for each section.\nActions & Recommendations\nThis component lets users select steps from a to-do list that can include Next Best Action recommendations, quick actions, screen flows, and field service mobile flows. For example, when a user opens a flow in a console app, the action launches in a subtab of the associated record. In a standard navigation app, it starts in a popup window. You can add this component to Lightning pages for supported objects.\nCustomer Insights\nThis component informs console users on which Knowledge articles a customer has looked at. It also shows if the customer has filed a case. As a result, console users don’t suggest articles that a customer has accessed or open duplicate cases, decreasing customer frustration and improving the support process.\nHighlights Panel\nThis component displays record highlights along with action buttons. Use this component to ensure that your console users can see critical information at a glance.\nKnowledge\nThis component helps console users quickly find relevant Knowledge articles for their cases and perform basic actions, such as attaching an article to a case.\n\nThis component provides similar functionality to the Knowledge Sidebar used in Salesforce Classic consoles. To use this component, Lightning Knowledge must be enabled in your org.\n\nMilestones\nThis component displays active, completed, and violated case milestones with a visual tracker. Agents can use the component to drill down into case milestone details.\n\nThis component provides similar functionality to the Case Milestone tracker in Salesforce Classic. To add this component, your org must have entitlements, an entitlement process, and milestones set up. The component supports only Case Milestones and doesn’t support Object Milestones. You can add it only to case pages.\n\nPath\nThis component displays a visualize representation of a business process. Use this component to guide your users through an object’s life cycle. In the Service Console, you can set up a path for cases. In the Sales Console, you can set up a path for opportunities, leads, quotes, contracts, and orders.\nRelated List - Single\nThis component displays a single related list for a record, including lists from a parent record.\n\nFor example, use this component to display Activity History front-and-center on all case pages, or even display cases for a parent contact.\n\nTIP To increase console efficiency, use this component to add the Files related list to record pages. With the Files related list, console users can drag files directly onto the related list.\nRelated Record\nThis component displays details for related records, including parent records.\n\nBehind-the-scenes, this component uses actions to provide your console users with built-in record creation and in-line edit. Console users can update records, create records, and link records—all without leaving the page.\n\nFor example, you can configure this component to show details about an associated contact on a case, or even the details of a case’s parent case.\n\nThis component provides similar functionality to the Lookup component used in Salesforce Classic consoles.\n\nTIP To change the displayed fields for the Related Record component, customize the associated action in Setup. If you don’t see the action or can’t modify it, create a new one.\n\nThe Service Console app comes with a default page for cases that includes Case Details and Contact Details information. This information is displayed using Related Record components. The quick actions used with these components can’t be modified because they’re provided by default. To customize the fields, first go to Setup and create a new quick action. Then modify the quick action layout. In Lightning App Builder, update the Related Record component to specify your action.\n\nSEE ALSO\nFlow Builder for Service and the Actions & Recommendations Component\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
