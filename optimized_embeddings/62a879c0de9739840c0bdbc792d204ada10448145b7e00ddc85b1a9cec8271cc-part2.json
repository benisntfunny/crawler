Use this information to begin marketing processes and activities within your account, including Journey Builder. The events collect data based on what actions your contact performs or occurrences involving your contact. You can target that behavior and modify your communications to better target that contact. For example, you can find out which contacts abandoned shopping carts and contact them to complete their order.\n\nNOTE An admin must enable contact events in Contact Builder for you to use this feature.\n\nEvent information flows into the application via the contactEvents REST API. This API provides event information for Marketing Cloud Engagement apps and writes that information to defined data extensions.\n\nTo bring event information into Contact Builder, complete these tasks.\n\nDefine the event in Contact Builder (using a sendable data extension as the entity to hold the event data).\nCreate the call using the contactEvents API to bring the information into the data extension linked to the event in Contact Builder.\n\nThe data extension used to contain this information must contain these fields.\n\neventInstanceID\nparentInstanceEventID\ncontactKey (This field identifies the data extension as sendable and links the event to the contact._\ndata, including these fields:\nkey, name, or ID identifying the data extension\nName and value pairs for all applicable event data\n\nThe event source generates event IDs that link to the event information. These IDs identify the specific event for later use. The contactKey field maps to the contact to which Contact Builder associates the event data.\n\nEnsure that you also include fields in the data extension used to contain any additional information provided by the event. The data extension must contain fields for all attributes to successfully write all data associated with the event. The name of these fields corresponds to the name part of the name and value pairs provided by the contactEvents REST API call.\n\nFor example, your data extension could include these name and value pairs.\n\nCustomer Key (acruz@example.com)\nOrder Number (123456)\nOrder Total (177.99)\n\nWhen you connect events to data extensions, you can access the data collected by an event as part of your segmentation and filtering activities. Use this data to determine how contacts receive information.\n\nContact abandons cart on the shopping site.\nEvent API collects data from the abandoned cart and passes information to Contact Builder.\nEvent serializes information to data extension for usage.\n\nAfter the information passes through the contactEvents REST API route to the data extension, Journey Builder can use that information to begin journeys or take steps within a journey. Journey Builder monitors that information and react accordingly to any additions or changes. You can interact with that information using the Journey Builder app and the Journey Builder Platform.\n\nCreate an Event\nFollow these steps to create an event in Contact Builder.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
