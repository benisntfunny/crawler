And for each group, indicate the affected user profiles, the scope of work, and the estimated schedule. Prioritize new features and technical work by the needs of the users in each group. Don’t worry about making the list perfect because you’ll refine the priorities after you get real user feedback from your pilot group.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nMaking the “who” decision is easy with your Readiness Report. Check the “Which Users Are Ready” section for the user profiles that are most ready for Lightning Experience. For the pilot group, pick a small team that will get immediate benefits. For subsequent phases, pick the next most ready profile, working your way up to the more complex cases.\n\nThe Readiness Report is also a great guide for defining the scope of work for each group. But first, look for items in the report that you can ignore altogether. If a feature isn’t used by anyone, or if the impact to users is minor, cross it off your list! Then look for features that are actively used by the profiles in your upcoming group and prioritize items that require attention.\n\nIn addition to fixing priority issues, set up a least one key Lightning Experience feature, like Path, Duplicate Management, or Lead Conversion. Pick a feature that speeds up common tasks or redefines the way users in the group work.\n\nTIP We make improvements to Lightning Experience and the Readiness Check regularly, so we recommend rerunning the Readiness Check occasionally. Issues that are noted in your Readiness Report may no longer be a problem by the time you start your implementation work.\nSEE ALSO\nCheck Your Org’s Readiness for Lightning Experience\nEnlist Champions to Validate Your Lightning Experience Rollout Priorities\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
