A conditional group can have these step elements: condition, calculation, lookup table, and subexpression. A condition step element is always the first element in the group. A condition step runs the step that follows if the condition expression evaluates to true. A condition step can only be used as part of a conditional group element, and not as a standalone step element.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions for Industries clouds that have Business Rules Engine enabled\nEXAMPLE A rule designer wants to create a conditional rule that calculates the discounted student fees for students aged 60 and above.\n\nThe designer has created these expression set resources to be used in the Conditional Group element.\n\nRESOURCE NAME\tTYPE\tDATA TYPE\nStudent_Age\tVariable\tNumber\nStudent_Fees\tConstant\tCurrency\nDiscounted_Student_Fees\tVariable\tCurrency\n\nHere’s how the designer has configured the conditional group:\n\nHere, in the condition element, the values in the Resource, Operator, and Value fields represent this condition: The student’s age is greater than or equal to 60.\n\nThe calculation element defines the action that is taken if the condition evaluates to true. The calculation runs only if a student’s age is 60 or above. Student_Fees is the constant with a value of $2,000. The result of calculating 2,000 minus 30% of 2,000 is stored in the output variable Discounted_Student_Fees.\n\nDefault and Advanced Modes in the Condition Element\nThe condition element in expression sets has two modes: default and advanced. When you add a condition element to an expression set, the condition opens in the default mode. The default mode has a no-code user interface to build your condition expression. You can also switch to the Advanced mode in the condition element to enter your expression manually.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
