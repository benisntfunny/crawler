TPM gives you a single view of all active promotions and provides tools for evaluating and refining your promotions to improve performance.\n\nTo use TPM, you need the LightningTradePromotionPkg and Trade Promotion Management licenses. To activate these licenses, contact your Salesforce account executive.\n\nWhat Is Trade Promotion Management?\nTrade Promotion Management (TPM) helps you oversee the promotions that you run for your retailers, from planning to completion, to ensure that each promotion achieves its objectives. Use TPM to streamline your team’s efforts, overcome the complexities of running several promotions concurrently, and unlock maximum results.\nGet Started with Trade Promotion Management\nTrade Promotion Management (TPM) helps you oversee the promotions you run for your retailers, from planning to completion and ensures each promotion achieves its objectives. With a single view of all active promotions, you can overcome the complexities of running several promotions concurrently, and evaluate and refine your promotions to unlock maximum results.\nConsumer Goods Cloud Trade Promotion Management Data Model\nThe Trade Promotion Management (TPM) data model is used to manage promotions, tactics, funds, and claims for customers and their products. You can use TPM to increase your market share or introduce new products to strengthen your brand.\nInstall the Managed Packages\nTo use Trade Promotion Management deploy the Consumer Goods Cloud managed package.\nSoft Limits\nConsumer Goods Cloud Trade Promotion Management controls some of its processes by using limitations to ensure convenient response times.\nManage Multiple Markets\nYou can segment data, business processes, and configurations for multiple markets without creating multiple Salesforce orgs by using sales organizations. You can group data according to geography, product division, or account team setup. For example, you can create a sales organization for each country that you do business in or to segment your master data, such as accounts and products, and transactional data such as promotions and claims.\nCreate and Organize Customers\nFor every entity with whom you have a TPM business relationship, create a customer record. These entities include retail stores, retail chains, restaurants, wholesalers, or ecommerce portals. These records are typically fetched from ERP systems. However, additional attributes and objects for supplementary data (such as TPM-specific roles and distribution profiles) are maintained in Salesforce. To easily run promotions at an individual-level as well as headquarter-level, create a customer hierarchy.\nCreate and Organize Products for Promotions\nTypically, all product data, including product hierarchies and attributes, is populated in Salesforce from an integrated ERP system. However, you can also create and manage products in Salesforce. You can plan a promotion for all products in a hierarchy or for a specific group of products.\nImport Data by Using MuleSoft Direct\nIntegrate data seamlessly and connect accounts, products, and their hierarchies from third-party systems to Consumer Goods Cloud without leaving the Salesforce platform. Use the prebuilt APIs to quickly connect to Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and get started with Consumer Goods Cloud with just a few clicks.\nCopy Processing Services Data to a Sandbox\nAfter you clone a sandbox, copy the CG Processing Services data when no operations occur in the source org. This practice ensures that your sandbox is a replica of the source org.\nManage Users\nTo control a user’s access based on their roles and responsibilities, assign them the appropriate license, permission set license, and permission sets. And to restrict the accounts and products that a user can manage, create user settings.\nCreate Account-Specific Product Lists\nTo ensure that the account plan for an account shows only the products that are relevant for the account and not all your products, create an account-specific product list. In an account plan and customer business plan, KAMs can see only the products that are in the account’s product list, and can create promotions only for these products.\nSync Data with CG Cloud Processing Services\nWhen you create or edit data in your Salesforce org, the data must be updated in a processing service. With SF Data Sync, you can choose the changed objects and sync the new data with the processing service. You can run the sync as a batch process, continuously, or at specified times.\nMeasure Promotion Performance with Key Performance Indicators\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) provide the business performance information, such as monetary, volume, and percentage measures. TPM uses KPIs in calculations that help you understand how a promotion and account plan perform based on current inputs. For example, you can estimate promotion costs and sales, and also analyze how effectively a promotion budget was used. You can use this information to keep a tab on the available budget for upcoming promotions.\nTrack Your Spending with Fund Management\nA fund holds money that serves as the promotion budget for either a customer, customer-category combination, or customer-brand combination. After KAMs (Key account managers) get their sales targets, FMs (Finance Managers) allocate a budget to the KAMs. KAMs can use their budget (fund) to pay for activities such as marketing campaigns, introduce new products, and placing displays that can help them achieve their sales targets. KAMs link the funds allocated to them to individual promotion tactics and transfer money from one fund to another.\nReview Your Sales Targets with Account Planning\nSee the aggregated KPI for a customer and product combination for a timeframe by using an account plan, which shows a profit and loss overview of an account.\nSet Up Promotions\nA promotion is a marketing and communication activity that boosts a product’s sales volume and revenue, and thereby helps enhance the brand’s long-term value.\nUplift Prediction\nUse prediction modeling to forecast the impact of a combination of promotions, tactics, and KPIs. Optimize the uplift volume by changing the KPIs and tactics in your promotion.\nSettle Promotion Costs with Claims Management\nAfter tactics of a promotions are executed, retailers send payments requests (claims) as compensation for the expenses they incurred while executing the planned tactics. The claims can either be manually created or imported from a third-party system..\nAnalyze Your Promotions with Real-Time Reporting\nCreate account and promotion-related real-time reports based on your requirements using Real-Time Reporting (RTR). RTR provides flexible configurations to design a fact-based report that uses the same KPIs and calculation rules as a promotion or account P&L. Use these reports to get a live view of critical business metrics and make better decisions during the account planning, promotion execution, and post-event analysis phases of Trade promotion Management (TPM).\nUnderstanding How KPI Values are Calculated\nConsumer Goods Cloud Trade Promotion Management (TPM) uses key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure performance at the promotion and account plan level.\nSmart UI\nSmartUI Lightning Components is a user interface layer that you can configure or customize without using code to avoid repeating tasks and saving every few minutes. For example, when you handle a promotion, you perform multiple click-and-save actions from creating the promotion header and saving, and creating and saving every tactic to adding the products for each tactic and saving each product individually. You can avoid all these repetitive clicks by using the Edit mode to plan a full promotion.\nCustomize Your Lists\nUse custom metadata types to customize columns, filters, and the logic to retrieve the data for lists.\nTrade Promotion Effectiveness\nTrade Promotion Effectiveness (TPE) is a CRM Analytics solution for Consumer Goods Trade Promotion Management (TPM). It provides data-driven dashboards to analyze trade promotion data, evaluate the effectiveness of a promotion, and make decisions for future promotions. By improving trade promotion tactics, you can increase sales and revenue, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nGet answers to the most frequently asked questions about Trade Promotion Management.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
