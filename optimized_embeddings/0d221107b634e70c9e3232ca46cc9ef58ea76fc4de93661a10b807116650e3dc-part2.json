You can still use it, but we highly recommended using the Lightning App Navigation method instead. For more information about how to make the switch, go to Customize a Lightning App Navigation Menu in the Salesforce Mobile App.\nAbout the Mobile Only App\n\nThe Mobile Only app is a navigation experience for the Salesforce mobile app. Admins customize the navigation menu for Mobile Only in Setup. Users see the navigation items when they tap Menu in the navigation bar. The first four items also appear in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.\n\nUsers can keep using the Mobile Only app, or they can switch to a Lightning app using the App Launcher. To learn how to customize the navigation menu for a Lightning app, see Customize a Lightning App Navigation Menu in the Salesforce Mobile App.\n\nIf users want to access the default Mobile Only navigation items again, they can switch back to Mobile Only via the mobile App Launcher.\n\nDisable the Mobile Only App\n\nThe Mobile Only app helps users transition to the new Salesforce mobile app. However, it might not make sense for your org if you’ve previously made Lightning apps available on mobile. You can disable the Mobile Only app by adding a connected app custom attribute.\n\nWARNING Don’t disable the Mobile Only app unless you’ve made a Lightning app available on mobile.\n\nTo disable the Mobile Only app, go to Setup. In the Quick Find box, enter Connected Apps, select Manage Connected Apps, and click the name of the connected app that you want to modify. In the Custom Attributes section on the connected app page, click New. Enter HIDE_MOBILE_ONLY_APP for the attribute key and “true” for the attribute value.\n\nNOTE Remember to wrap the attribute value in quotation marks.\n\nThe Mobile Only app is disabled when the user force quits the Salesforce mobile app or logs in to a new session. On the next launch, the user sees the default Lightning app. On all subsequent launches, the user sees the most recent Lightning app that the user accessed on mobile.\n\nCustomize Navigation Items\n\nYou can include Visualforce pages, Lightning pages, and Lightning components. Make sure you’ve created tabs for those items first. To create a tab, from Setup, enter Tabs in the Quick Find box, and select Tabs.\n\nTo customize navigation items, in the Quick Find box, enter Navigation, and select Salesforce Navigation. After you save your changes, refresh the Salesforce mobile app to see the changes.\n\nTIP When organizing the menu items, put the items that users use most at the top.\n\nDepending on your organization’s settings, the menu can contain:\n\nMENU ITEM\tDESCRIPTION\nApproval Requests\tDisplays a list of the user’s pending approvals. Users can tap an approval item and approve or reject it from within Salesforce. Available in Salesforce for iOS.\nCanvas apps\tAppears for organizations that have enabled a canvas app to appear in the navigation menu.\nChatter\tThe user’s main feed. Appears for organizations that have Chatter enabled.\nDashboards\tAvailability depends on edition and user permissions. If you don’t add this item to the navigation menu, dashboards and the Dashboards item are automatically included in the set of Smart Search Items.\nEvents\tLists events owned by the user, that the user created for him- or herself, and that the user or a user’s groups are invited to. If you don’t add this item to the navigation menu, events and the Events item are automatically included in the set of Smart Search Items.\nForecasts\tDisplays the Forecasts app, a helpful tool for every member of a sales team to track forecast data and monitor progress towards quota. Available in Salesforce for iOS. Your org must have Collaborative Forecasts enabled.\nGroups\tAppears for organizations that have Chatter enabled. If you don’t add this item to the navigation menu, groups and the Groups item are automatically included in the set of Smart Search Items.\nLightning component tabs\tOnly custom Lightning components that have a Lightning component tab associated with them can appear in the navigation menu.\nLightning pages\tCustom app pages.\nNews\tDisplays the News app, a one-stop place for news and other insights about the user’s accounts, contacts, leads, and opportunities.\nNotes\tDisplays the Notes app. If you don’t add this item to the navigation menu, notes and the Notes item are automatically included in the set of Smart Search Items.\nPeople\tAppears for organizations that have Chatter enabled. If you don’t add this item to the navigation menu, profiles, and the People item are automatically included in the set of Smart Search Items.\nReports\tAvailability depends on edition and user permissions. If you don’t add this item to the navigation menu, reports and the Reports item are automatically included in the set of Smart Search Items.\nSmart Search Items\tPuts a list of recently accessed items in the navigation menu. Anything you put below the Smart Search Items element appears below those recent items. If Smart Search Items is one of the first four items in the navigation menu, some recent items also appear in the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen.\nTasks\tLists of a user’s open and closed tasks and tasks that have been delegated. If you don’t add this item to the navigation menu, tasks and the Tasks item are automatically included in the set of Smart Search Items.\nToday\tAn app that helps users plan for and manage their day by integrating mobile calendar events with associated Salesforce tasks, accounts, and contacts. The app also allows users to instantly join conference calls, quickly log notes about events, and more.\nVisualforce page tabs\tOnly Visualforce pages with the Available for Lightning Experience, Experience Builder sites, and the mobile app checkbox selected are displayed in the Salesforce mobile app.\nThings to Keep in Mind\nYou can’t set different menu configurations for different types of users.\nAnything represented by a tab in Salesforce—such as standard and custom objects, Visualforce pages, the Chatter feed, People, or Groups—is visible for a user in the Salesforce mobile app menu, based on the user’s profile settings. For example, if a user is assigned to a profile that has the Groups tab set to Tab Hidden, the user doesn’t see the Groups menu item in the Salesforce mobile app navigation menu, even though an admin has included it in the menu.\nThe navigation menu in an Experience Builder site isn’t controlled via the Navigation Menu settings page. Instead, the tabs that are specified in Tabs & Pages in the site’s administration settings determine the contents of the site’s navigation menu.\nIf your users don’t yet have a history of recent objects, they see these default objects in the Recent section initially: accounts, cases, contacts, leads, and opportunities. It can take up to 15 days for objects they work with to appear in the Recent section. To make objects appear under Recent sooner, they can pin them from the search results screen in the full Salesforce site.\nLightning Apps by Default\nStarting in Winter ‘22, the Salesforce mobile app defaults to a phone-activated Lightning app if it’s available to the user. Previously, all users had Mobile Only app navigation, but they could switch to a different Lightning app by using the App Launcher from the Menu tab. The Salesforce mobile app now selects the first available Lightning app by default—instead of Mobile Only—resulting in a change in the navigation bar at the bottom of the page. Users who don't have access to any phone-activated Lightnings apps default to Mobile Only.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
