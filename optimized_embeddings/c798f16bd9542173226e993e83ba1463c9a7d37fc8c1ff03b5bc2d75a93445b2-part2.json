But the benefits go beyond a better user interface. The UI framework in the Lightning Platform empowers IT and business teams to quickly build and launch new apps and services with clicks instead of code. Which means your company has the flexibility and independence to revamp processes and features to keep up with changes in your business. Make the case for your leadership by showing how moving to Lightning Experience can realize your business goals and improve your company’s bottom line. We have some resources to help.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nReview the Forrester Consulting reports on the total economic impact of transitioning to Salesforce Lightning for Sales Cloud and Salesforce Lightning for Service Cloud. These studies analyze the cost savings and business benefits from moving to Lightning Experience and the Lightning Platform.\nRun the Business Assessment Calculator for the projected benefits of moving your org to Lightning Experience.\nCheck out your org’s Lightning Experience Readiness Report for some predictions about the benefits and productivity improvements you can realize.\n\nCommon reasons for investing in Lightning Experience include delivering a better user experience, adopting features and capabilities that solve business problems, improving processes, and getting access to Lightning innovation and faster app development technology. The case is even more compelling if you can tie the transition to a key business driver like the launch of a new sales program or a major transformation initiative.\n\nReview Current Business Processes\nThe move to Lightning Experience is an opportunity to simplify and consolidate your business processes, address issues that are affecting user adoption, and otherwise clean house. As you evaluate your org for Lightning Experience, look for the places where you can make your users happier and more productive instead of simply moving over everything in your current implementation.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
