The email contains the member’s order details, points accrued for the order, and updated points balance.\n\nThe journey sends two other emails after the initial welcome email:\n\nOne day after the first email, an email is sent informing the member that they can earn points for posting about their purchase on social media.\nOne day after the last email, an email is sent recommending the member a few related products and promotions.\n\nEngage Members after Redeeming Points\t\n\nSends an email when transaction journal with the type Redemption and subtype Purchase is processed for the member. The email contains the member’s order details and the details of the points and vouchers redeemed.

Create a custom object in your Salesforce instance to store the details of members whose tier is upgraded.\nCreate Apex Trigger to Populate Custom Object with Upgraded Tier-Member Data\nAn Apex trigger automates adding data of members whose tier is upgraded in the Tier Upgrade Target Member custom object.\nPrepare Marketing Cloud Instance for Loyalty Management Journeys\nMake data from the Loyalty Management app available in your Marketing Cloud org so that the Loyalty Management journeys can send out personalized emails to members.\nInstall and Deploy Loyalty Management Journeys in Marketing Cloud\nYou can add Loyalty Management journeys to your Marketing Cloud instance by installing and deploying the Loyalty Management Journeys package.\nComponents of the Loyalty Management Journeys Package\nThe Loyalty Management Journeys package contains journeys, email templates, images, data extensions, and automations. You can customize the components provided with each journey based on your company’s requirements.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
