You can fine-tune access with permission sets and custom profiles, which is great for doing a phased rollout to a pilot group or specific teams of users. Or go for it and set your entire organization loose if things are ready for everyone. You can also control who immediately switches to the new interface, who stays in Salesforce Classic until they switch themselves, and who can’t switch back to the classic interface. The power is yours.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nProfiles and Permission Sets available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nNOTE Okay, if you use Group Edition, that’s overstating things. You can’t remove the Lightning Experience User permission from your org’s standard profiles, and custom profiles aren’t available. So it’s “all or nothing” in Group Edition. But you can control who switches immediately to the new interface and who remains in the classic interface until they’re ready to switch themselves.\n\nUsers require the Lightning Experience User permission to access Lightning Experience. By default, this permission is automatically enabled for all users with a standard Salesforce profile. Custom profiles don’t usually include the permission.\n\nCustom profile users: Decide who gets Lightning Experience access now and who you’ll set up later. Consider these options.\n\nWant to roll out Lightning Experience to a subset of custom profile users without giving access to everyone assigned to the profile? Create a permission set that includes the Lightning Experience User permission. Then apply the permission set to the desired users.\nReady to roll out Lightning Experience to everyone assigned to a specific custom profile? Or do you want to enable all your custom profile users? Adding the Lightning Experience User permission to profiles is the fastest way to mass-enable the new user interface for users.\nTIP If you have experience with Data Loader, save time by updating many profiles at once. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Take care you don’t inadvertently enable or disable other features.\nHave you created any custom profiles by cloning a standard profile? Starting with Winter ’16, custom profiles inherit the Lightning Experience User permission from standard profiles. You can edit these profiles to disable the user permission, as needed.\n\nStandard profile users: If you’re not ready for some of these users to access Lightning Experience yet, move them to custom profiles that don’t include the Lightning Experience User permission.\n\nNOTE If you’re limiting Lightning Experience to a subset of your users, try to keep all members of a functional team on the same experience. If you have team members who often share links and work closely together, include them all in the same rollout group. See Considerations for Switching Between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic for more details. See Considerations for Switching Between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic for more details.\nWhat Happens When Users Get Access to Lightning Experience\nUsers who existed when Lightning Experience was turned on\n\nAll users who existed at the time Lightning Experience was enabled retain Salesforce Classic as their default interface. This is true whether a user already had the Lightning Experience User permission or was assigned the user permission at a later date. It doesn’t matter if the user permission is assigned via a standard profile, a custom profile that has the permission enabled, or a permission set.\n\nUsers added after Lightning Experience is turned on\n\nThings change for users who are added to your org after Lightning Experience was enabled. These users get Lightning Experience as their default interface when they’re assigned the Lightning Experience User permission—whether at the time they’re added to the system or at a later date. Again, it doesn’t matter if the user permission comes from a standard profile, a custom profile that has the permission enabled, or a permission set.\n\nLightning Experience-enabled users can continue accessing Salesforce Classic! These users automatically get the Switcher, which allows them to switch between the new and classic interfaces, as needed.\n\nManage Access to Salesforce Classic\n\nWhen you’re ready for users to call Lightning Experience home, there are several options for driving adoption. Choose what’s right for each user.\n\nEncourage users to stay in Lightning Experience by automatically switching them out of Salesforce Classic on a daily or weekly schedule. Users can return to the classic interface, but they’ll keep getting switched back to Lightning Experience at the next scheduled interval. See Encourage Users to Stay in Lightning Experience.\nStart cutting the chord to Salesforce Classic. For users who have everything they need in the new interface, remove the Switcher link. See Make Lightning Experience the Only Experience for Some Users.\nWhen you’re ready for everyone to dive into Lightning Experience without looking back, turn off Salesforce Classic access altogether. See Turn Off Salesforce Classic for Your Org.\nSEE ALSO\nProfiles\nPermission Sets\nLightning Experience at Your Pace (video)\nSalesforce Classic Doesn’t Go Away When You Move Users to Lightning Experience\nConsiderations for Switching Between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\nMake Lightning Experience the Default Interface\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
