Learn with Trailhead\n\nB2C Solution Architecture with Key Salesforce Clouds\n\nThe Salesforce B2C architecture runs on three highly scalable platforms: Salesforce, Commerce, and Marketing.\n\nCommerce Platform (1) is a highly scalable B2C Commerce platform for web and mobile eCommerce.\nProducts built on the Salesforce Platform (2), including Sales, Service, Communities, Order Management System, Force.com applications, CRM Analytics, Salesforce Customer Identity, and Customer 360 Privacy Manager, run on the same physical platform and share a common data model.\nAPIs enable integration with other Salesforce and non-Salesforce platforms.\nThe Salesforce Platform can be used for customer master and consent management, or it can integrate with a third-party Master Data Management system.\nOrder Management System (OMS) is a Commerce Cloud product, but it runs natively on the core Salesforce Platform.\nCRM Analytics has direct connections to the Salesforce Platform and is best suited for Sales and Service analytics.\nCustomer Identity features SSO and authentication management to ensure employees, customers, and partners sign on safely across all of your applications and systems.\nCustomer 360 Privacy Center manages data retention, rights, and actively manages consent to ensure compliance with global and local privacy and consent rules.\nData Cloud unifies and segments your marketing data, and activates to any endpoint, across messaging advertising, and personalization.\nMarketing Platform (3) is a grouping of Marketing Automation products that includes:\nMarketing Cloud enables personalization, journey orchestration, and cross channel messaging.\nDatorama for deep marketing analytics.\nInteraction Studio provides real-time interaction management, personalization, and AI driven recommendations.\nSocial Studio provides social monitoring and interaction.\nAudience Studio is used to create complete profiles across first, second, and third-party data and to segment, and activate that data.\nMuleSoft Anypoint Platform (4) provides API management and system to system integration.\nTableau provides business intelligence analytics.\nMuleSoft can integrate third-party systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Product Information Management (PIM), and Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) with Salesforce.\nTableau (5) is a business intelligence platform and has direct connections to the rest of the Salesforce ecosystem.\n\nConnectors enable the connectivity that allows cross-cloud actions required to support sophisticated use cases such as handling abandoned carts and personalized marketing recommendations.\n\nB2C Solution Architecture with Salesforce Connectors\n\nConnectors are point-to-point connections provided by Salesforce that allow customer experiences to cross Marketing, Service, and Commerce platform boundaries.\n\nMarketing Connector (1) allows the Commerce platform to initiate actions in the Marketing platform.\n\nTrack page views, searches, product views, cart contents, and order placement.\nManage marketing opt-ins, email subscriptions, and preferences.\nTrigger transactional email, including account creation and update messages, password recovery, customer service messages, and order confirmation.\nSync data such as product catalogs, customer information, order details, and promotional details.\nThis connector is community code and provides a development framework for customers to follow.\n\nService Connector (2) connects Commerce Cloud to Service Cloud. Commerce products usually initiate actions, but service products can pull data from Commerce Cloud.\n\nSubmit cases from a storefront for anonymous or registered customers.\nRetrieve case details for a registered storefront customer from Service Cloud.\nSync profiles of registered customers and profile-specific addresses between Commerce and Service Clouds.\nSync order data between Commerce and Service Clouds.\nThis connector is community code and provides a development framework for customers to follow.\n\nMarketing Cloud Connect (3) connects Marketing platform products with Sales and Service Cloud products. The connector allows data to sync between clouds. It also allows Marketing Cloud products to trigger events such as emails and journeys based on Sales and Service Cloud data.\n\nAutomatically sync data from Sales or Service Cloud to Marketing Cloud.\nConnect Journey Builder to other clouds.\nUse Sales and Service Cloud data to construct email.\nProvide Marketing Cloud email tracking data such to Sales and Service Cloud products.\n\nDistributed Marketing (4) allows users in Sales and Service Clouds to view, personalize, and send on-brand, best practice content through Marketing Cloud.\n\nUse data stored in contact, lead, or person account records to address emails.\nCraft email to a segment of customers based on a list view.\nSend email about a campaign to a group of customers based on a touchpoint cadence managed by Marketing Cloud.\n\nSocial Customer Service (5) turns social network posts into case or lead records.\n\nHeroku Connect (6) syncs data between the Heroku app platform and the core platform.\n\nCreate a data lake.\nBuild, deploy, and monitor other highly scalable customer-facing mobile and web applications.\nB2C Solution Architecture with Key Use Cases\n\nVarious key use cases can be implemented through Connectors and APIs.\n\nUse Cases Initiated from Core\n\nExplore Cross-Cloud Engagement Data Models\nDistributed Marketing\nOrder on Behalf of a Customer\n\nUse Cases Initiated from Commerce\n\nTurn Abandoned Carts into Completed Sales\nRedeem Coupons\nPersonalize Marketing Recommendations\nKeep Customers in the Loop with Transactional Email\nView Order History and Cancel Orders\nEngage Customers with Conversational Commerce\nImplement Seamless Cross-Cloud Identity\n\nUse Cases Initiated from Marketing\n\nTurn Social Media Posts in to Leads and Cases\nRun Conversational Campaigns with WhatsApp\nRun Conversational Campaigns with SMS\n\nB2C Experience Solution Kits outline required products, connector considerations, and configurations to implement these key use cases.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Architectural Diagrams: Quick Look\nSolution Kits for Retail and B2C\nBusiness Scenarios for Retail\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
