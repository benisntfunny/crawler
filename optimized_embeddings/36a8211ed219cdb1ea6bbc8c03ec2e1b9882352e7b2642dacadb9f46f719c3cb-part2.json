By default, Salesforce organizations created after June 22, 2010 have Chatter already enabled for all users. However, if you want Chatter to be available to a limited group of people in your org, you can do a profile-based rollout instead.\n\nWith a profile-based rollout, only users who have been assigned the required user profile or permission set have access to Chatter. A profile-based rollout is useful for larger companies and companies or government agencies with regulatory constraints. It allows such orgs to plan a controlled deployment on a department-by-department basis.\n\nAlthough we recommend an org-wide Chatter deployment, the option to limit its availability is there. Ask Salesforce about enabling a profile-based Chatter rollout. Chatter is secure and works in accordance with all the security and permission settings in your Salesforce organization.\n\nProfile-Based Chatter Rollout Overview\nA profile-based rollout of Chatter makes Chatter available to a controlled set of users instead of all users in your organization.\nEncryption for Chatter\nEncryption for Chatter lets you encrypt sensitive data when it’s stored, and not just when it’s transmitted over a network. As of the Winter ’18 release, mass encryption and decryption of Chatter data is generally available. To enable encryption for Chatter, contact support for help with setting it up.\nChatter Settings\nIn Salesforce and the Salesforce mobile app, Chatter is enabled by default. Configure various Chatter features and customize the Chatter experience for your users on the Chatter Settings page in Setup.\nPublisher Actions and Layouts\nActions add functionality to the Chatter Publisher in Salesforce Classic. Actions let your users do more in Salesforce across all devices.\nEnable Code Snippets and Assign Permissions to Use Them\nUse code snippets to enter syntax-highlighted code samples through the Chatter publisher. To make code snippets available, enable them and assign the permission to use them. There are two ways to enable code snippets and assign permission: through a user profile (step 1) or through a permission set (step 2). Code snippets are available in Lightning Experience and Experience Builder sites that are based on the Customer Service template.\nAssign Pin Post Permission\nPin your most critical information to the top of a feed. In group and topics feeds, an authorized user can pin up to three posts. A pinned post stays in place until an authorized user unpins it. After you enable post pinning through Chatter Settings, you can assign the Pin Posts in Feeds permission through a permission set or a user profile.\nFeed Tracking\nFeed tracking detects changes to tracked record fields and posts them as updates in the What I Follow feed. Users who follow a record, see those updates in their view of What I Follow, with one exception. Updates users make themselves aren’t posted to What I Follow. Users can see those updates in their profile feeds.\nChatter Email Settings and Branding\nChatter email settings let you change the format of your company’s outgoing emails and control whether users receive email notifications.\nAdd Your Custom Brand to Email Notifications\nCustomize your company’s Chatter email notifications to show your company’s sender information, footer text, and footer logo.\nChatter Post Actions and Layouts\nActions on posts and comments appear in the drop-down menu on a post or comment. Users can edit, bookmark, mute, and delete posts, add topics, and create tasks from posts.\nGroup Layouts\nThe group layout lets you customize which fields, buttons, actions, and lists appear in Chatter groups. Changes to the group layout affect all groups in your organization, but they appear only on the group pages in the Salesforce mobile app. Changes to the group publisher appear in both the full Salesforce site and the Salesforce mobile app.\nTopics for Objects\nTopics for objects offers a powerful way to crowdsource your company's key themes and issues. Users can add topics to records to organize them by common themes.\nCustomize Chatter Influence\nCustomize activity thresholds for posts, comments, and likes to improve the Chatter influence calculation.\nAllow Users to Thank Their Coworkers\nRecognize your coworkers with thanks badges and post your thanks directly to the Chatter feed.\nGuidelines for Deleting Your Users’ Chatter Messages\nSalesforce administrators with the Manage Chatter Messages permission can access all users’ private messages via SOAP API. You can view and delete any message (for example, for compliance).\nReport on Chatter with the Dashboards Package\nThe Chatter Dashboards package for Salesforce Classic packs a punch! You get multiple dashboards, over 100 reports, and even custom report types. Use the dashboards to monitor and manage Chatter adoption and engagement in your organization.\nChatter Desktop\nControl access to Chatter Desktop and install and configure the Chatter Desktop Managed Version.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
