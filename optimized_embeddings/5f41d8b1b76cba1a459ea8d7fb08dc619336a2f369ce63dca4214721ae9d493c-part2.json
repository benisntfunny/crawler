Each task has a priority, a number of days in which it must be completed, and a person who is responsible. Action plans are created from action plan templates, which allow you to capture repeatable tasks. Users see the tasks assigned to them through task lists and views. Users record task status information using the standard interfaces for tasks or the Action Plan details view. Target records, such as accounts or contacts, also show lists of related action plans.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Automotive Cloud, Consumer Goods Cloud, Education Cloud, Financial Services Cloud, Government Cloud with Lightning Scheduler, Health Cloud, Manufacturing Cloud, Nonprofit Cloud, and Public Sector Solutions. View edition availability.\n\nFor example, in Financial Services Cloud, you can create an action plan template for financial plan review meetings with clients. For such engagements, wealth managers need to set up a meeting in advance, collect financial documentation, and review the documentation. You set up this action plan template once, and update it as your understanding of the repeatable tasks refines over time. Then as wealth managers need review meeting with clients, you can create an action plan based on the template. You don’t have to worry about all the appropriate tasks getting created because those tasks are defined in the template.\n\nAction Plans Editions\nReview the supported products and editions for Action Plans.\nAction Plans Data Model\nYou can create an action plan template and its generated action plans for various objects, depending on the products and licenses available in your org. You can also create them for custom objects that have Activities enabled.\nWhich Features Work with Action Plans?\nYour users interact with action plans using standard features.\nAction Plan Lightning Components\nPut action plans in front of your users by including Lightning components in the user console.\nSet Up Action Plans\nTo enable Action Plans, add Action Plan Templates to the navigation bar of relevant apps and update affected Lightning pages to include action plans.\nWork with Action Plans and Templates\nDiscover the information you need when working with action plans effectively and efficiently.\nUpdate API Implementations of Action Plans\nIn Summer ’19, Action Plans expanded object support to more standard and custom objects. If your API implementation of Action Plans references TargetId and assumes it’s an account record, you must update your code.\nCopy and Distribute Action Plan Templates\nCreate an action plan template based on an existing one by cloning it. Share action plan templates between organizations by packaging them.\nSet Up Action Plans in Partner Communities\nMake action plan templates and action plans available to your partner communities. Create and assign user profiles for partner community users and customize your community home and record detail pages. Action Plans are available in partner communities that have an External Apps for Financial Services license or a Customer Community Plus for Financial Services license.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
