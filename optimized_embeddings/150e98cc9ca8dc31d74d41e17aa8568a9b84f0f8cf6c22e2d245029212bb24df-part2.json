Volunteers can sign up for volunteer projects on your site and update their time spent on volunteer activities.\n\nVolunteer Management helps you manage volunteer projects at scale and amplify reach by sharing volunteering opportunities to external sites. You can identify, create, and publish volunteer project information on your Experience Cloud website. You can also easily assign a contact to a volunteer project within Salesforce.\n\nVolunteers can easily search the list of available volunteer projects, sign up for those that they’re interested in, or accept assignments.\n\nWith just a few clicks, volunteers can view and update information about activities they signed up for. They can update the start and end times, add completed hours, or add information about a project.\n\nAssign Permission Sets and Permission Set Licenses\nWith permission set licenses, users can get more features than with the basic license. To enable users to work with Volunteer Projects and Volunteer Shifts, assign them the necessary permission set licenses.\nAssign User Profile and User License for Volunteers\nTo enable volunteers to work with Volunteer Projects and Volunteer Shifts, assign them the necessary user profile and user license.\nSet Up Volunteer Management for Your Site\nSet up your Emergency Response site to include Volunteer Projects and Volunteer Shifts. Allow volunteers to view and sign up for volunteer projects. Enable volunteers to view and perform various volunteer-shift-related updates such as updating completed hours, changing the status, or uploading a file attachment.\nConfigure the Standard ERM User Profile\nEnable access for ERM users who coordinate Volunteer Management projects and shifts.\nConfigure Volunteer Shift Cancellation Settings\nAutomatically update the number of registered volunteers and volunteers needed when shifts are canceled.\nConfigure the Default Shift Status\nSet the default status for the shift record when a volunteer signs up for a volunteer project from the site.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
