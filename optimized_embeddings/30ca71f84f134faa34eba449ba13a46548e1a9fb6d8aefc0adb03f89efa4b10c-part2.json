Over the years, Health Cloud has gradually moved away from distributing new features through the managed packaged, and instead has built its features directly on the core Salesforce platform.\n\nWhat this means for you as a user is that most of the features under this section have newer and better alternatives that your organization can use for improved performance. And if you’re not sure whether your org uses a managed package feature or a core platform feature, check with your Salesforce admin for more information.\n\nGive Agents and Managers Valuable Patient Insights with Analytics for Healthcare (Managed Package Feature)\nAnalytics for Healthcare lets care coordinators, utilization managers, and referral managers gain critical insights and visualize key metrics about their patient populations. Payers and providers can use actionable insights from the app’s dashboards to drive intelligent engagement and improve care effectiveness and efficiency.\nManage Patient Risk with Analytics for Health Cloud: Risk Stratification (Managed Package Feature)\nThe Analytics for Health Cloud: Risk Stratification app gives you prebuilt dashboards that help identify your at-risk patients and enroll them in a care management program in Health Cloud. Through dashboards of configurable patient data and custom charts, you can gain new insight into the patients your company manages.\nUse Care Plans to Help Patients and Members Reach Their Goals (Managed Package Feature)\nCustomizable care plans represent an action plan for improving a person’s health. These care plans help your patients or members take practical steps to improve their health every day. You can manage chronic conditions, provide preventive care, and apply health and wellness protocols with care plans.\nContact Tracing for Employees (Managed Package Feature)\nWith Contact Tracing for Employees, you can manage the manual contact tracing process and track the spread of disease while caring for your employees.\nGet to Know the Health Cloud Console (Managed Package Feature)\nAs a busy healthcare professional, you need one place to manage your patients or members and the tasks associated with their care. The Health Cloud console pulls everything you need into a complete view of a person, their care team, and activities relevant to getting and keeping them healthy. It also provides a central place to manage communication between the individuals involved in their care. Communications, such as messages to the primary care physician or reminders to the family member who drives them to the doctor, are all in one place.\nManage a Patient or Member’s Relationships (Managed Package Feature)\nKnowing who lives with the patient or member and seeing their role and relationship can be an important factor in ongoing care. A person's household includes caregivers, businesses, and others who are involved with their health.\nMonitor Patient Referrals (Managed Package Feature)\nUse Health Cloud components to track and prioritize referrals.\nMonitor Health Events Over Time (Managed Package Feature)\nThe timeline gives you a snapshot of someone's healthcare events and activities in chronological order. You can select any time scale and see all the important details of a person's care or filter the events to see a targeted view. So it’s super easy to get a snapshot of the person's prescriptions from last month, or look at next month’s medical events.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
