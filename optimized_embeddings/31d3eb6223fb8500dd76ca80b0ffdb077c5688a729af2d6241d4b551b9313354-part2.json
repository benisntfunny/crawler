But before you actually start the work, take a little time to validate your priorities by testing the default state of Lightning Experience. Ask a champion user in the upcoming rollout group to take the new interface for a test drive, and then get their feedback on what’s working and what’s not. This feedback may reveal that things you thought were problems aren’t and that you haven’t accounted for features or processes that the rollout group needs.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nThe Readiness Check and the Readiness Report are available in English only.\nPick your Lightning Experience champion: Choose someone in the upcoming rollout group and enlist their help. Champions are your super-users—people who are enthusiastic about Salesforce and regularly offer recommendations for making it better. If no one comes to mind, choose someone who is vocal about improving your business processes or is the first to adopt new technologies.\nGive your champion access to Lightning Experience: Create a permission set with the Lightning Experience User permission and assign it to your champion.\nTrain your champion: Spend a little time showing your champion around Lightning Experience. Sit next to them as they get started and help with any questions. Resolve issues quickly to make good use of the champion’s time.\nLet your champion fly: Have the champion do their job in Lightning Experience for a week. Show them the Switcher so they can get back to Salesforce Classic if they’re stuck on something. Ask your champion to record experiences and recommendations on how to better meet business needs.\nGet feedback: Talk to your champion about what’s working well and which features aren’t ready for prime time.\nRevise your rollout plan: Decide which of the issues identified by your champion are critical and which are nice to have. Adjust the priorities for your upcoming rollout group to address business-stopping issues. You can leave secondary items for future iterations. And remember that users can always switch back to Salesforce Classic so you don’t need to delay your rollout if some features aren’t perfect yet.\n\nRepeat these steps at the start of each group in your rollout plan.\n\nSEE ALSO\nKick Off the Lightning Experience Readiness Check\nVerify that Lightning Experience is Turned On\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
