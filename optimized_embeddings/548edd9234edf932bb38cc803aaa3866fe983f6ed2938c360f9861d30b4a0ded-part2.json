Ideally, search functionality includes facilities vaccine doses, and stock availability.\n\nVariations\nDepartments of public health may make this available on their websites. Commercial organizations like a Pharmacy or Clinical Administrator may make locations searchable across their organization or locations.\nTechnical Capability\n\nUse Health Cloud Provider Data Model to enable identification of sites and capabilities.\n\nYou might require integration to source providers and facilities. Consider the need to integrate with third-party sources, such as national or state healthcare provider registration databases.\n\nConsider Intelligent Sales to predict stock shortfall.\n\nProduct and Feature Options\nPRODUCTS\tFEATURES\n\nHealth Cloud\nMuleSoft\nExperience Cloud\n\t\nProvider Data Model\nIntelligent Sales\nVACCINE SCREENING INTAKE & PRIORITIZATION\n\nAbility to accept individuals identified for vaccination, and automate prioritization and capture consent. Also, the ability to handle walk-ins not pre-identified or prioritized.\n\nVariations\nSimilar to testing, departments of public health might offer a triage feature on their websites. Clinicians could use such a feature for individuals seeking vaccines or arriving for vaccination.\nTechnical Capability\n\nConsider the Lead object for patient referral and initial triage.\n\nUse flows or lead conversion to create person accounts to represent patients.\n\nConsider the use of Clinical Assessment for triage assessment.\n\nConsider Salesforce Knowledge for guidelines or inline flow.\n\nProduct and Feature Options\nPRODUCTS\tFEATURES\n\nHealth Cloud\nMuleSoft\nExperience Cloud\n\t\nFlows\nClinical Assessment\nKnowledge\nVACCINE CONSUMER SCHEDULING\n\nAbility to verify that an individual is approved for scheduling. Also, the ability for individuals to choose time slots based on available slots and provide confirmation of appointments and send reminders.\n\nVariations\nDepartment of health, clinicians, pharmacists, and anyone administering vaccines might require this capability. The business process and automation needs vary across these organizations.\nTechnical Capability\n\nIf expected appointment volumes are <1 million, consider using Lightning Scheduler.\n\nIf high appointment volumes are expected, consider using alternative AppExchange products.\n\nEnsure careful assessment of business requirements and review product limitations related to Lightning Scheduler for fit.\n\nIndividuals who sign up for an appointment should be able to do so using a variety of communications channels including web, app, email, text, or phone call. This is needed not just for appointment scheduling, but also for future notifications, such as vaccine recall, schedule reminders, and more.\n\nProduct and Feature Options\nPRODUCTS\n\nLightning Scheduler\nExperience Cloud\nSMS\nPROVIDER SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\n\nAbility for providers to publish and manage their availability for appointments and to synchronize with their vaccine stock and ordering backlogs.\n\nVariations\nProviders and pharmacists who are primary users may need to manage schedules.\nTechnical Capability\n\nUse the territory and resource management capabilities of Lightning Scheduler.\n\nProduct and Feature Options\nPRODUCTS\n\nLightning Scheduler\nExperience Cloud\nPRE-VISIT OR POST-VISIT ENGAGEMENT\n\nProvide pre-visit instructions, electronic capture of medical histories, and electronic capture of COVID-19 questionnaires and waivers. Also, provide post-visit instructions and how to report any negative effects.\n\nTechnical Capability\n\nConsider Experience Cloud for public-facing engagement. Record clinical data in appropriate electronic health record (EHR) objects via integration or flows. Consider EHR condition, EHR observation, EHR medication prescription, EHR vaccination protocol, and EHR immunization.\n\nFor document capture, consider automating document management for Health Cloud.\n\nFor post-visit engagement, consider surveys, Social Studio, and Marketing Cloud Engagement.\n\nProduct and Feature Options\nPRODUCTS\tFEATURES\n\nHealth Cloud\nMuleSoft\nExperience Cloud\nMarketing Cloud Engagement\nSocial Studio\n\t\nEHR Data Model\nSurveys\nCOVID-19 TESTING DETAILS\n\nAbility to display any details related to COVID-19 testing for the patient, including upcoming appointments or past COVID-19 test results.\n\nVariations\nDepartments of public health may need this data aggregated and patient specific for contact tracing. Clinicians may need this information to inform their decisions on vaccine administration.\nTechnical Capability\n\nUse appropriate electronic health record (EHR) data model, for example, EHR observations and EHR condition to track testing status.\n\nProduct and Feature Options\nPRODUCTS\tFEATURES\n\nHealth Cloud\nMuleSoft\nExperience Cloud\nMarketing Cloud Engagement\nSocial Studio\n\t\nEHR Data Model\nSurveys\nCOMMUNICATION CONSENT MANAGEMENT\n\nAbility for the individual who signs up for an appointment to select preferences for communication including email, text, or phone calls. This is needed not just for appointment scheduling, but also for future notifications, such as vaccine recall, schedule reminders, and more.\n\nVariations\nDepartments of public health and clinicians both require the ability to communicate with members of the public. A key distinction to consider in gathering consent is the nature of the content. A consideration is to ensure any consent captured has context for the purpose of COVID-19 trace, test, and immunization.\nTechnical Capability\n\nMost basic implementation: standard opt-out fields on person accounts.\n\nFor more fine-grained consent management, consider the Consent Object Model.\n\nIf Marketing Cloud Engagement is being implemented, consider using Email Studio or Audience Studio for preference management.\n\nConsider where consent management is controlled.\n\nProduct and Feature Options\nPRODUCTS\tFEATURES\n\nMarketing Cloud Engagement\nPlatform\n\t\nPerson Accounts\nConsent Data Model\nEmail Studio or Audience Studio\nSEE ALSO\nVaccine Management Capabilities\nSafety Cloud\nVaccine Management Blueprint\nVaccine Management Users\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
