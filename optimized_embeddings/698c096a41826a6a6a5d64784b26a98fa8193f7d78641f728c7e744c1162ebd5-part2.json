For example, people who walk in to a mental health awareness talk. You can also track disbursements for recipients of benefits without a schedule or session. For example, people from a flood-affected area who receive emergency help kits as part of a one-time kit distribution benefit.\n\nRecipients are of one of these types:\n\nProgram Enrollment\nRecipients who are participants in at least one program.\nWalk-in\nRecipients who have an account or contact record in Salesforce, but aren't added in any program as participants.\nAnonymous\nRecipients who don't have an account or contact record in Salesforce.\n\nSelect the recipient type based on your use case. For example, select Walk-in to track disbursement for someone with a Salesforce account who walks in to a paper bag making workshop. Select Anonymous to track disbursements for people who received the emergency help kits during a flood, considering their accounts or contacts aren't available in Salesforce.\n\nWhen you select a walk-in recipient, program enrollment, benefit assignment, and benefit disbursement records are automatically created. Also, the recipient type value on the benefit disbursement record is updated to Walk-in. For an anonymous and program enrollment recipient, a benefit disbursement record is created per recipient.\n\nIf your organization supports anonymous recipients, you must create a program enrollment record for an anonymous recipient type. When you select an anonymous recipient, benefit assignment and benefit disbursement records are automatically created, and the program enrollment record that you created is associated with the benefit assignment record.\n\nNOTE You can avoid data skew while managing a high volume of anonymous participants by creating multiple program enrollment records of anonymous recipient type. When an anonymous type of program enrollment record reaches ~10 K benefit disbursements, create another program enrollment of anonymous type and set the earlier program enrollment as inactive.\nCreate Program Enrollment for Anonymous Benefit Recipients\nBefore you can track benefit disbursements for anonymous recipients, create at least one program enrollment record.\nCreate Ad Hoc Benefit Disbursements\nUse the ad hoc bulk disbursements to track benefit disbursements for people who didn't enroll but received a benefit or for benefits without a schedule or session.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
