Rebate program managers can create effective, flexible ship and debit rebate programs to incentivize their partners. They enroll partners, dealers, and distributors as well as ship-to partners and customers to these programs. Rebate program managers can optimize the special prices and discounts offered to partners by defining the right mix of special pricing terms and benefits.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Developer, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions that have Ship and Debit Process Management enabled\nCreate a Ship and Debit Program\nRebate program managers can create a ship and debit rebate program to create a scalable, streamlined incentive structure for special prices and discounts.\nEnroll Distributors and Ship-To Partners in a Ship and Debit Program\nEnroll in a ship and debit program, distributors, partners, and dealers who receive ship and debit incentives, and customers and ship-to partners to whom distributors sell products. To validate the claims submitted by subsidiaries of distributors or ship-to partners, define the types of relationships between the related parties and create relationships between their accounts.\nCompensate Your Partners for Competitive Pricing with Special Prices and Discounts\nRebate program managers can create special pricing terms to define flat discounts and reference prices for partners when partners sell competitively priced products. Rebate program managers can create special pricing term benefits to craft nuanced, tiered incentive structures and differentiate benefits by the product quantity sold, the period the product was sold in, or both.\nShip and Debit Incentives for Distributors and Their Subsidiaries (Example)\nCreate ship and debit programs to define multi-tiered ship and debit incentives for distributors. Define the relationships between a distributor and their subsidiaries. Here’s an example that shows a semiconductor manufacturer that creates a ship and debit program for their partner distributors.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
