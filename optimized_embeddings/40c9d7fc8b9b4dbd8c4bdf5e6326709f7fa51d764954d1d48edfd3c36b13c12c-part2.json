Chats and messages are delivered to team members alongside their other work in Salesforce, so they can handle cases, chats, messages, and everything else side by side.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nEssentials is available in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Essentials, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nWeb Chat\n\nEmbed web chat into your website or help center with the option to let customers log a case when your team’s away. You can display the chat button for customers in your website and help center.\n\nYour team can accept chats in the Service Console. The first 100 characters of the customer's message appear in the chat header, so you can easily differentiate between all your in-progress chats (1). The Past Chats tab lets you quickly refer to previous chats with the customer (2).The handy toolbar gives you what you need to provide speedy service (3).\n\nFacebook Messenger for Essentials\n\nFacebook Messenger for Essentials connects your business’s Facebook page to Salesforce, so messages to your page don’t go unseen. Make sure that you have a business page ready to go before setting up Messaging.\n\nYou can respond to messages in the same place as your chats: right in the Service console. Your chats, messages, cases, and everything else open in tabs so you can take on multiple conversations at a time. Easily create related records so you don't lose important information, and your customers always get what they need.\n\nHow to Get Started\n\nEssentials comes with 1 license of Web Chat and 1 license of Facebook Messenger for Essentials, so you can start right away. When you're ready, you can purchase more licenses for your team from the Manage Subscription page.\n\nWant to see it in action? Our 1-mnute feature tour will show you how it all works. Watch the tour:  Talk to Customers in Real Time with Chat and Messaging (1 minute)\n\nThe Chat and Messaging setup pages are where you can dive in using simple guided setup flows. If you’re adding your team, the users you select during each flow can immediately start receiving chat and message requests. All they have to do is use the App Launcher to switch to the Service Console app, open Omni-Channel from the utility bar, and change their status to Available - Chat or Available - Messaging.\n\nTo add web chat to your website, paste the provided code snippet into your website before the closing body tag (</body>) on the pages where you want the chat button to be displayed.\n\nTo add web chat to your help center, drag the Embedded Service Chat component into your help center using the Experience Builder. Then open the security settings in the Experience Builder and add your chat endpoint URL as a trusted site. The chat endpoint is in your embedded chat code snippet as the baseLiveAgentContentURL. (If you lost your code snippet, you can find it in Setup | Embedded Service.)\n\nSEE ALSO\nSet Up Chat\nSet Up Messaging\nManage Trusted URLs\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
