There, you'll learn how to create an attribute category, its attributes, a rating fact spec, a coverage, and the root product itself.\n\nIt's all part of an end-to-end series of training modules called Small Group Quoting - A Hands-on Experience, which focuses on defining new small group product offerings, and which shows you how to set up ratings for products, guiding you all the way through to a finished quote.\n\nHealth Services\n\nThe following illustration shows some of the current key Vlocity services and where they are used in various process flows.\n\nProduct Attributes in Product Specs\nProduct attributes are key pieces of the whole Vlocity Insurance and Vlocity Health platform. They define coverages, insured items, and other parts of insurance products and health plans. They correspond to anything that's important to quoting, rating, and writing an insurance policy. Attributes include inputs to rating (pricing), and characteristics that define claims.\nChild Specs for Root Products\nChild specs are key building blocks for your product models. They're components of the root product specs that Vlocity rates, quotes, sells, and administers for your customers.\nConfirm Health Plan Types and Market Segments\nBefore creating new health plans, you may want to confirm that the plan types and market segments provided by Vlocity conform to your line of business. Otherwise, you can create or modify them as follows:\nCreate a New Health Plan\nYou can create a new health plan based on the available health plan types and market segments.\n/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=ind.v_health_rate_bands_and_rate_tiers_477599.htm\n\nCreating Bulk Renewals\nThe renewal business process begins once a customer (individual or group) is sold. But plan designs often change, so renewals must take into account when benefit plans are retired and what new plans take their place.\nProduct Configuration Change Log\nSalesforce allows you to track changes made to object fields, up to twenty fields per object. Vlocity took this history tracking concept to the next level, so that product administrators can also view changes that are made to a product spec, specifically changes made to:\nProduct Report Generation\nProduct report generation allows a product administrator to create field and attribute level reports, in CSV format, for selected products.\nSmall Group Benefits Administration\nVlocity Health provides business processes, common in the health industry, for small group benefit administration.\nLarge Group Plans\nVlocity Health offers a complete set of business modules and features to allow you to build and sell insurance products to customers in the large group market.\n/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=ind.v_health_create_custom_numbering.htm\n\nConfigure and Use Trailing Documents Requirements\nEnrich your org's data by giving Vlocity and Community users the ability to upload documents associated with government, insurance, and health plan objects. For example, let underwriters for property insurance upload required survey and inspection documentation. Let customers applying for life insurance upload required medical test results.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
