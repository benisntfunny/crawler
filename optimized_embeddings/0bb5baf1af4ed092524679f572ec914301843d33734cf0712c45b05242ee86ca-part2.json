Rules, Process Builder, and Flows turn your repetitive workload into automated actions that do work for you.\n\nChoosing the right tool depends on your goal.\n\nAssignment, Escalation, and Auto-Response Rules are pre-defined. These rules work with the lead or case records. Specifically:\n\nLead assignment rules automatically route a new lead to the right user.\nWeb-to-lead and case auto-response rules automate your first reply to a lead or customer.\nCase escalation rules let you automatically route a case to the right user.\n\nIf you want to do something outside the narrow scope of rules, check out Process Builder. A Process is a simple if/then statement: If certain criteria are met, then take an action.\n\nEXAMPLE If the VIP field is checked on a Contact record, then send an email to all VIP contacts.\n\nUse Process Builder to automate record creation, record updates, emails, and more.\n\nFlow Builder is your backup plan when you want to do something Process Builder can’t. For example, you want to automate record deletion. Or you want to base your criteria on more than one kind of record. Flows help you automate such edge cases.\n\nOur Support Coaches compiled a list of recipes for common business processes you can automate.\n\nCreate a Round Robin Lead Assignment Rule\nKeep your team's workload even by auto-assigning new leads to each user.\nReach Out to Customers After Winning an Opportunity\nOur process builder recipe can automate your communication with a contact or customer from whom you won an opportunity. After winning an opportunity, you often have a reason to reach out to the contact or customer. For example, you want to thank them. Or you want to send them a survey to rate customer satisfaction. Maybe that follow-up is even an opportunity to cross-sell.\nRemind Your Sales Team When a Renewal Comes Due\nCreate a Process to remind users when a customer's recurring subscription comes due. Reduce churn by nurturing your recurring revenue.\nAllow Customers to Opt Out of Emails\nGive customers the choice to opt out of marketing emails. Flow builder logs a lead or customer's unsubscribe request in Salesforce. Process Builder launches the Flow when there’s a new unsubscribe request.\nSEE ALSO\nAssignment Rules\nSet Up Auto-Response Rules\nSet Up Escalation Rules\nProcess Builder\nFlow Builder\nChoosing Which Salesforce Flow Feature to Use\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
