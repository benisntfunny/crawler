After changes are merged in the source control system, the promotion is completed in DevOps Center or by using Salesforce CLI.\n\nAfter you select which work item you plan to work on, you can have DevOps Center create the feature branch or you can create the feature branch using the tools of your choice. Be sure to create the feature branch from the first pipeline stage’s branch, for example, Integration. Work item feature branches must follow this naming convention:\n\nhttps://github.com/<GitHub-ID>/<Repo-Name>/tree/WI-000000\n\nExample:\n\nhttps://github.com/jdoe/Recruiting_App/tree/WI-000015\nIMPORTANT If you’re working directly in GitHub, delays can occur between when these actions happen and when they’re reflected in DevOps Center. If you take subsequent actions on the related objects in DevOps Center before they’re reflected, you're likely to see unexpected or inconsistent behavior. For metadata changes, we recommend that you wait for delayed events to be reflected in DevOps Center. For non-metadata changes, such as updates to the .forceignore file, you can continue with the promotion.\nIn DevOps Center, create a work item or select an existing one to associate with the work.\nDecide how you want the feature branch created.\nTo have DevOps Center create the feature branch, click the work item ID. Select I Want to Develop and Commit My Changes to the Work Item Feature Branch From Outside of DevOps Center, then click Proceed.\nCreate the branch directly in GitHub from the first pipeline stage’s branch using the required naming convention.\nUse another tool, such as Salesforce Extensions for VS Code, to create a feature branch from the first pipeline stage’s branch using the required naming convention. Be sure to push the feature branch to the project repository.\nAfter the branch is created and the event is reflected in DevOps Center, the work item status moves to In Progress. You can start your development work.\nAfter you complete your development work, commit your changes in the source control system.\n\nIf you commit your changes locally, don’t forget to push them to the repository. After you commit your changes, the changes in the feature branch are reflected in DevOps Center.\n\nDecide how to create the change request and promote your changes to the first stage in the release pipeline.\nCreate the change request and promote your changes in DevOps Center. See Review Changes with Team Members and Promote Individual Work Items to continue.\nCreate a change (pull) request and merge your changes in the source control system, then complete the promotion in DevOps Center. See Promote Changes Merged Outside of DevOps Center to continue.\nCreate a pull request and merge your changes in the source control system, then deploy the changes to the pipeline stage’s environment using Salesforce CLI. See Deploy Changes Using Salesforce CLI (Beta) for details.\nSEE ALSO\nWork in a Connected Dev Environment\nPromote Changes Merged Outside of DevOps Center\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
