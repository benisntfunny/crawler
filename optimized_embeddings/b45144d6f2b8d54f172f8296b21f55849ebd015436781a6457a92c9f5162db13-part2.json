After you decide what you want to predict, the field you want to predict values for, and what object contains that field, you’re ready to build.\n\nBuild AI predictions with clarity and ease. Guided Setup flow walks you through building predictions using learning cards, info bubbles, notifications, and Salesforce Help.\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Einstein Prediction Builder. Then select Einstein Prediction Builder. Or, in Setup Home, on the Einstein Prediction Builder tile, click Get Started.\nIf it’s your first time using Einstein Prediction Builder, on the splash page, click Get Started. Otherwise, skip to the next step.\nClick New Prediction.\nOn the Name & Type page, name your prediction. For example, Annual Revenue Prediction.\nTab or click in the next field to auto-populate the API name.\nTab or click in the next field to describe the prediction.\nChoose your prediction type. the For example, to predict whether customers register for a particular event, you can choose the Yes/No prediction. Or, to predict how much revenue you'll make this year, choose the Number prediction. Then click Next.\nOn the Object page, select the object that contains the field that you want to predict values for. To quickly find an object, enter its name in the search field. Then click Next.\nYou can optionally focus the prediction on a specific segment in your dataset. On the Segment page, click Segment of {Object}, for example, Segment of Account. Then click Save & Next.\nOn the Example Records page, define your yes and no examples. Then click Save & Next.\nNOTE By default, Einstein only scores records that aren’t in your example set. Use filters to define which records to score.\nOn the Included Fields page, deselect fields that you want Einstein to consider for your prediction.\nNOTE When building a prediction, you can select and deselect fields to include in your prediction model. By default, all fields are selected. When you deselect specific fields, the prediction is built using only the remaining selected fields.\nOn the Records to Predict page, select which the records you want Einstein to predict. Then click Next.\nOn the Score Field page, name the field that will store your prediction scores. For example, Predicted Annual Revenue.\nTab or click in the next field to auto-populate the score field API name. Then click Save & Next.\nOn the Review & Build page, review your prediction settings carefully. To make changes, go back to the page where you want to make updates. Then click Next to get back to the Review & Build page again.\nWhen ready, click Build Prediction.\nCheck back later to review your prediction’s scorecard before you decide whether to enable your prediction. After you enable the prediction, Einstein checks records hourly and provides new scores for records that changed.\nNOTE You can’t edit predictions in enabled or pending status. To edit a prediction that’s enabled, first disable it so you can change your settings.\nSegment Your Data\nWhen you build a prediction in Einstein Prediction Builder, you can also focus your prediction on a specific segment of your dataset. For example, to only look at data for a particular region or industry. With segments, you can get more useful predictions by excluding records that aren’t relevant to your prediction.\nCheck Your Data\nData Checker automatically validates your data and alerts you as you build a prediction. It provides feedback in real time so you can catch issues early.\nDefine Your Prediction Set\nYou can define the set of records that Einstein provides prediction results, scores, for. This set of records is your prediction set or scoring set (as known by data scientists). By default, Einstein scores all records that aren’t included in your example set. You can choose to have Einstein score records in your example set, or you use filters to choose a specific set of records to score.\nDefine Scoring Settings\nWhen Einstein scores records, these results are stored in a custom field called the score field. You must give the field a new name and API name each time you create a prediction or clone an existing one.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
