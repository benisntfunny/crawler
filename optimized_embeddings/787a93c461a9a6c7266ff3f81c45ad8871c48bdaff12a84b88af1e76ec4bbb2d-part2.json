Share a file with a public group so that all Chatter users in your company can see it. By default, anyone who can see a file can share it.\n\nTo share a file with one or more Chatter groups:\n\nShare the file from one of these locations:\nOn the detail page of the file you want to share, click  File Sharing Settings | With group. Or click Show All on the Shared With list then click Groups in the Sharing Settings dialog box.\nNext to the file in a feed, click More Actions | File Sharing Settings then click Groups in the Sharing Settings dialog box.\nNext to the file on the Files page, the Files Owned by list, or the Group Files list, click  Share with groups.\nOn a file hover, click  Share File then click Groups in the Sharing Settings dialog box.\nEnter the name of the group you want to share the file with, and select it by clicking its name. Repeat this step to share with more groups.\nSelect access levels for each group. By default, private group access is set to Collaborator, while public group access is set to Viewer.\nOptionally, add a message to your post. You can @mention people and groups in your message to notify them and post the file in their feed.\nClick Share and Close. The file is posted to each group that you shared it with and @mentioned.\n\nA private file shared with a private or unlisted group becomes a privately shared file and displays the privately shared icon (). The file is posted to the group's feed, and only the file owner and group members can find and view the file. All users in your company can view any file that’s shared with a public group. A file that’s shared with a public group displays the “your company” icon (), and is posted to the group's feed.\n\nTo stop sharing a file with a person or group, in the Sharing Settings dialog box, click  next to the person or group's name.\n\nThere is no share button or option on the file detail page on an Experience Cloud site or in an internal org, if the file originated from the site.\nDocuments from the Documents tab and attachments from the Notes and Attachments related list aren't listed on Files home. And they can't be shared as Salesforce Files.\nIf content files are part of a content pack or delivery, they can be shared with more people than shown in Share with People.\nA file can be shared a maximum of 2000 times. This count includes shares with records, people, and groups. If a file is approaching the maximum number of shares, consider creating a public link or making the file public by posting it to your feed.\nSEE ALSO\nGroup Files Lists\nView Where a File Is Shared\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
