To help users identify which site a notification came from, the site name is listed after the time-stamp.\n\nPush notification—An alert appears on the user’s mobile device when a user has installed the Salesforce mobile app for Android or iOS. These alerts can consist of text, icons, and sounds, depending on the device type. If you enable push notifications for your org, users can choose whether to receive push notifications on their device.\nNOTE To enable push notifications, you must also enable in-app notifications.\n\nThe content of mobile push notifications can be displayed outside of the Salesforce mobile app, such as on a mobile device’s lock screen. Full content push notifications are enabled by default for the Salesforce mobile app, but you can choose to display minimal content instead.\n\nStandard and Custom Notifications\n\nYou can send both standard notifications and custom notifications.\n\nStandard notifications—Available for use cases predefined by Salesforce, like reminding a user of an upcoming deadline or notifying a user when someone mentions them on Chatter.\nCustom notifications—Tailored to your own use cases. For example, you can alert an account owner if a new support case is logged while trying to close a deal. Or you can send a notification for a unique workflow built entirely with custom objects. Create and send custom notifications from Notification Builder in Setup.\n\nThe behavior of standard and custom notification types depends on the delivery settings for each type. You can manage the delivery settings for your org’s notification types from Notification Delivery Settings in Setup.\n\nFor a notification type to be delivered to the Salesforce mobile app, you must enable the mobile channel and the desired versions of the Salesforce mobile app. For most standard notification types, the mobile channel and the Salesforce mobile app are enabled by default. However, not all standard notification types are available for the Salesforce mobile app.\n\nEnable Salesforce Mobile App Notifications\nAllow all users in your organization to receive in-app and push notifications.\nDisable Full Content Push Notifications\nThe content of mobile push notifications can be displayed outside of the Salesforce mobile app, such as on a mobile device’s lock screen. Full content push notifications are enabled by default for the Salesforce mobile app, but you can choose to display minimal content instead.\nConsiderations for Salesforce Mobile App Notifications\nBefore you begin sending notifications, learn about the considerations specific to in-app and push notifications.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
