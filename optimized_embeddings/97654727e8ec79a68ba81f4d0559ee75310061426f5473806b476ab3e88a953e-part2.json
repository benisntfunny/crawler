Other activities, such as managing or contributing to libraries, aren’t available in the app. Here’s how working with content libraries is different from what users can do in the desktop site.\n\nThe Private Library folder isn’t available. Instead, a user can access the files in their private library by selecting the Owned by Me filter in the Files list on Files home.\nWhen viewing libraries, the top content, popular tags, recent activity, and most active contributors sections aren’t available.\nUsers can’t:\nSee content detail pages\nUpload and publish new or revised files to libraries\nPublish web links in libraries\nEdit content details\nAdd, edit, or delete comments\nDelete files (Salesforce for iOS and Salesforce for Android)\nMove files to different libraries\nUse tags to classify or filter content\nSubscribe to libraries, files, authors, or tags\nProvide feedback on content, or review feedback on content\nDelete, archive, or restore content\nContent search options like filtering by file type, author, or library name aren’t available. But users can use global search to find files in libraries.\nCreating or managing content deliveries isn’t available. This includes generating an encrypted URL for sharing files and content packs with customers.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
