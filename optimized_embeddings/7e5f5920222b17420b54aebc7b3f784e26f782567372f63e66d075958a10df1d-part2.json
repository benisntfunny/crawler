After you save, activate, and run the Data Processing Engine definition, a dataset is created. The newly created dataset is associated with the actionable list definition.\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Actionable Segmentation, and then select Actionable Segmentation Settings.\nClick New Data Processing Engine Definition.\nEnter a name for the list definition.\nNOTE Enter a name that contains alphanumeric characters and begins with a letter.\nSelect an object for which you want to create the list definition.\nNOTE Review the list of objects that you can use to create an actionable list definition in Actionable Segmentation Objects.\nClick Next.\nClick Launch Data Processing Engine Definition.\nIMPORTANT The Data Processing Engine page opens, and you can view the list definition name that you entered. You can also view the data source node that was created for the object that you specified when creating the list definition. For example, if you selected the Account object when creating the list definition, the data source node is created with the name Account_DS. ID and Name fields of this primary object are preselected and are mandatory. You can’t delete the data source node created for the primary object.\nCreate data source nodes for all the objects that are required to create the list definition. For example, to include Lead and Opportunity objects in the list definition, create two data source nodes, one for each of these objects.\nCreate joins, filters, and any other required nodes.\nIMPORTANT When creating an aggregated field by using the node of type Group and Aggregate, ensure that you group the aggregated field using the object Id field of the object that’s used to create the list definition.\nCreate input variables if necessary.\nCreate a writeback object.\nIMPORTANT\nWhen creating writeback objects, ensure that you select the Target Type Save as dataset in Analytics, and select the folder name as ActionableSegmentation.\nIn the Field mapping section, ensure that you map all the required fields that you want to include when creating actionable lists.\nIn the Field mapping section, you can’t map a field if it’s derived from one or more encrypted fields or if it’s derived from multiple fields (for example, Total Balance = Current Balance + Saving Balance).\nIMPORTANT In the Field mapping section, you can’t map a field if it’s derived from multiple fields. For example, Total Balance = Current Balance + Saving Balance.\nSave the definition.\nActivate the definition.\nNOTE\nValidate the definition to make sure that it’s correct and can be run. Any errors in the definition are highlighted when you activate a definition. Warnings are also provided. Warnings help you identify issues to fix or ignore.\nYou can’t update the data processing engine definition without deactivating the associated actionable list definition. Before reactivating any actionable list definition, ensure that you run the associated data processing engine definition to reflect the latest changes.\nRun the definition.\nTo view the actionable list definition and the associated dataset name and status, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Actionable Segmentation Settings, and then select Actionable Segmentation Settings.\nCreate a List Definition by Using a Predefined Data Processing Engine Definition\n\nUse Data Processing Engine definitions that have been previously created to ensure their availability when you plan to create actionable list definitions. Predefined Data Processing Engine definitions help you to create actionable list definitions quickly and easily.\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Actionable Segmentation, and then select Actionable Segmentation Settings.\nClick Use Existing Data Processing Engine Definition.\nEnter a name for the list definition.\nNOTE Enter a name that contains only alphanumeric characters and begins with a letter.\nSelect an object for which you want to create the list definition.\nNOTE Review the list of objects that you can use to create an actionable list definition in Actionable Segmentation Objects.\nSearch for select a Data Processing Engine definition. Only the Data Processing Engine definitions meeting these criteria are listed:\nThe object that you selected in the previous step must match with one of the data source node objects of the Data Processing Engine definition that you plan to select here.\nThe process type must be Actionable List and the runtime platform must be CRM Analytics.\nNOTE Learn how to create Data Processing Engine definitions that are compatible to create an Actionable List Definition in Create Data Processing Engine Definitions for Actionable List Definitions.\nSave the actionable list definition.\nTo view the actionable list definition and the associated dataset name and status, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Actionable Segmentation Settings, and then select Actionable Segmentation Settings.\nCreate Data Processing Engine Definitions for Actionable List Definitions\n\nCreate Data Processing Engine definitions that can be used to create actionable list definitions. Create, activate, and run Data Processing Engine definitions so that the datasets associated with these definitions are available for you to create new actionable list definitions.\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Data Processing Engine, and then click Data Processing Engine.\nClick New.\nEnter the name and API name for the Data Processing Engine definition.\nSpecify the process type as Actionable List.\nIf you want to reuse this Data Processing Engine definition, save it as a template.\nClick Next.\nClick CRM Analytics as the runtime platform.\nClick Done.\nCreate data source nodes for all the objects that are required to create the list definition. For example, if you want to include Lead and Opportunity objects in the list definition, then create 2 data source nodes for each of these objects.\nCreate joins, filters, and any other required nodes.\nIMPORTANT When creating an aggregated field by using the node of type Group and Aggregate, ensure that you group the aggregated field using the object Id field of the object that you plan to use to create the actionable list definition.\nCreate input variables if necessary.\nCreate a writeback object.\nIMPORTANT\nWhen creating writeback objects, ensure that you select the Target Type Save as dataset in Analytics, and select the folder name as ActionableSegmentation.\nIn the Field mapping section, ensure that you map all the required fields that you want to include when creating actionable lists.\nIn the Field mapping section, you can’t map a field if it’s derived from one or more encrypted fields or if it’s derived from multiple fields (for example, Total Balance = Current Balance + Saving Balance).\nSave the definition.\nActivate the definition.\nNOTE\nValidate the definition to make sure that it’s correct and can be run.
