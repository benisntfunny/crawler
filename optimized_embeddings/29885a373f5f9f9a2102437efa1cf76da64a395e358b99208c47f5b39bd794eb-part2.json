Action Launcher helps your users to resolve customer requests and issues quickly and deliver better customer service. For example, users can initiate a fee-reversal flow or launch a service-order action from Action Launcher.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Starter, Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions with the required add-ons\n\nYou can launch these types of actions through Action Launcher:\n\nActive screen flows, field service mobile flows, and autolaunched flows\nAura components\nButton- and link-based actions or WebLinks\nFlow orchestrations\nOmniScripts\nQuick actions\n\nHere are a few points to remember about actions.\n\nAutolaunched flows don’t require user input.\nAction Launcher supports record-based OmniScripts that are created using Salesforce OmniStudio and file-based or out-of-the-box OmniScripts.\n\nTo associate actions with a record page, create an Action Launcher deployment.\n\nAction Launcher Add-Ons and Permissions\nUsers access Action Launcher in their Salesforce org through supported editions, add-ons, and permissions.\nCreate an Action Launcher Deployment\nCreate a deployment that includes the component settings for the Action Launcher component.

The deployments come preconfigured with context objects, actions, and frequently used actions that you can easily modify to meet your business requirements.\nIntegrate Service Catalog with Action Launcher\nHelp your contact center agents (CCAs) to search for and launch service processes instantly through Action Launcher. Service processes use OmniScripts to provide a smooth and effortless customer service experience to CCAs.\nProvide Access to OmniScripts\nGive standard users or contact center agents (CCA) access to OmniScripts so that the users can see OmniScripts in the Action Launcher search results.\nLaunch Actions\nComplete your work quickly by launching actions easily from the Action Launcher component.\nLaunch Service Processes\nEfficiently assist customers by quickly launching service processes from Action Launcher.\nConfigure Action Launcher in Your Experience Cloud Site\nTo help people launch actions through Action Launcher without logging in to Salesforce, add Action Launcher to your Experience Cloud site.\nEdit an Action Launcher Deployment\nModify the type of actions, the context, and the actions available for your users in a deployment.\nDelete an Action Launcher Deployment\nDelete the deployments that are no longer required.\nSEE ALSO\nQuick Actions\nCustom Buttons and Links\nWebLink\nOmniStudio\nFlow Orchestration\nLightning Flow for Service Developer Guide\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
