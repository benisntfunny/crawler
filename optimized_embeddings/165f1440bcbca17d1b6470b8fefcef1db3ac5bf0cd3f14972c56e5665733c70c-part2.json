The Sales tab on the Original Equipment Manufacturer Performance dashboard in the CRM Analytics app provides insight about top-selling products and product sales by region and period.\nManage Stakeholders in Automotive Cloud\nAssess and share comprehensive information about the people involved in the automotive lifecycle. Automotive Cloud makes it easy for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and dealer groups to represent all types of stakeholders and account structures. Capture information about business profiles, households, and organization structures of your dealer groups, customers, and suppliers.

And with components such as relationship cards and relationship graphs, get quick access to all stakeholder details.\nManage Leads and Opportunities in Automotive Cloud\nAutomotive Cloud comes with enhanced lead management capabilities that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and dealers can use to capture comprehensive lead information. Capture the time frame during which the lead is interested in the transaction and the items that they’re interested in. You can also capture information about the account that provided the lead, and the lead’s preferred dealers. When the lead gets converted into an opportunity, the granular information is retained and available for dealers right through the lifecycle of an opportunity. The Leads tab on the Dealer Performance dashboard in the CRM Analytics app provides insight about lead conversion rates and lead pipeline by region and period.\nManage Vehicles and Assets in Automotive Cloud\nManage the lifecycle of assets and vehicle to effectively serve your customer needs.

Service agents can resolve queries related to transactions, charges and fees, balances and statements, and title transfers. Agents can use the action launcher to quickly reverse a fee or change the address related to a financial account. They can track key record alerts and milestones, assign interest tags, visualize relationships on interactive graphs, and upsell financial products and services.\nSchedule Appointments in Automotive Cloud\nSchedule timely test drive appointments and vehicle service appointments using the predefined Automotive Scheduler guided flows. Test drive appointments can be scheduled by internal users and dealers.
