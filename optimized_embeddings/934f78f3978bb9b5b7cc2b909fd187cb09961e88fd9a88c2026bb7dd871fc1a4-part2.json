When you use Einstein, the security of your business and customer data is protected by the Einstein Trust Layer. Choose which Einstein features can help your business. These features aren’t dependent on each other, so you can enable them separately.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo enable Einstein features:\tMarketing Cloud Admin permission set\nGet Started Quickly with Campaign Briefs\n\nTo jump-start a new marketing effort, Einstein can draft a campaign brief and suggest a relevant segment. To use this Einstein Co-Create feature in Marketing Cloud Growth, you enable settings for generative AI and in Data Cloud.\n\nEnable Einstein generative AI.\nTo turn on Einstein Segment Creation, search Features, select Feature Manager, and enable the feature.\nTo turn on Einstein campaign briefs, search Create, select Co-create with Einstein, and click Activate.\n\nAfter you turn on these features, they’re immediately available.\n\nOptimize Email Send Times\n\nEinstein Send Time Optimization (STO) is a predictive AI feature that optimizes your email sends based on historical data that indicates when individuals are most likely to open them. To use this feature, your org must opt in to the Global Data Model for Einstein.\n\nVerify that you have an identity resolution ruleset that uses Individual as the primary data model object.\nThis ruleset must be one of the first two identity resolution rulesets that you create for Marketing Cloud Growth.\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Send Time, and select Einstein Send Time Optimization (STO) with Global Models.\nReview the global model information, and click Activate.\n\nSTO needs some time to gather data and build a model that’s specific to your data. To check on the STO model status, return to the setup page. If you deactivate this feature, new messages can’t use it, but existing email sends still include optimized send times.\n\nFor more information about data, review the STO Model Card.\n\nFilter Non-Human Clicks from Your Report\n\nEinstein Metrics Guard uses predictive AI to filter bot activity from your org’s engagement metrics. It removes most clicks and opens generated by security scanner bots without filtering out legitimate visitor activity.\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Messaging.\nUnder Email, select Email Feature Settings.\nTurn on the feature.\n\nIf you deactivate this feature, your engagement metrics are more likely to include bot activity.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
