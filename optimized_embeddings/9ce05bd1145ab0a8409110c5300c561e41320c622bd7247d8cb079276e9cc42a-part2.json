Use the industry blueprint to understand how Salesforce Customer 360 platform capabilities help structure, organize, and support digital transformation.\n\nMap customer-facing business capabilities that are common to retail banking to the stages of the customer lifecycle across marketing, sales, customer onboarding, origination, and fulfillment, through to servicing and the post-sales experience.\nDetermine which capabilities are most important to your organization and prioritize implementation accordingly.\nOrganize projects that deliver business value with maximum benefit.\nGain alignment among key business process stakeholders.\nUnderstand the high-level platform capabilities and the Salesforce partners needed to power your organization’s business needs.\n\nContact your Salesforce account team or a Salesforce partner for help with assessing the business and platform capabilities most suited for your organization.\n\nThe typical lifecycle of a retail banking customer relationship has eight phases, from pre-sales marketing to relationship renewal.\n\nMarketing and sales process management capabilities help retail banks acquire new relationships and deepen existing ones.\n\nMarket: Retail banks require marketing capabilities to drive acquisition, customer support, and marketing operations strategies.\nLead: Banks identify, segment, and nurture leads.\nProspect: After a lead shows interest or a referral agrees to be contacted, sales activities focus on understanding the customer’s needs and identifying products and services to recommend.\n\nOnboarding, origination, and fulfillment capabilities include traditional compliance capabilities, building an understanding of the customer, and connecting customers with products and services.\n\nCustomer: Banks develop a deeper understanding of customer preferences. Compliance checks performed at this time are critical.\nDeposits and Lending: Origination, underwriting, documentation, and booking and funding processes are completed.\nServices: Banks set up services associated with a newly booked account, enable customers for those services, and execute documents.\n\nCustomer support plus renew and grow capabilities address customer needs as they evolve.\n\nCustomer Support: Service levels vary depending on customer needs. Support includes basic transaction inquiries to researching more complex service needs, which can include complaint resolution.\nRenew and Grow: Banks deepen connections with customers and grow relationships by advising on changing service needs.\n\nSalesforce partners with independent software vendors (ISVs) and consultants to extend platform capabilities to suit business processes.
