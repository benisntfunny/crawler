The reference architecture helps communicate the vision and strategy of a solution to business executives and stakeholders. Learn with Trailhead\n\nBusiness success can be conceptualized as success in each of three categories of capabilities: Foundational, Platform, and Functional.\n\nOur reference architecture presents Platform and Functional capabilities. Each layer contains a representative subset of systems or capabilities that are most relevant in the B2C Retail space. It does not list all possible systems or capabilities.\n\nPlatform Capabilities\n\nThese components form the underlying technology base for achieving your goals. Each layer in the platform builds on top of the next. B2C systems typically rely on these elements.\n\nData Sources\nData sources are systems that create, collect, and manage various types of data. These systems can act as systems of record. They’re often purpose-built to handle particular functionality and data requirements, but some provide for general system needs.\nIntegrations\nIntegrations include tools and routes that connect systems of record with each other or with higher-level experiences. These are varied tools, such as APIs that connect separate systems, single sign-on services to manage customer identity across different interfaces, and customer data platforms to segment customers.\nIntelligence\nSmart automation like machine learning and AI helps you optimize your use of customer data. The intelligence layer serves functions like delivering actionable customer insights, personalized product recommendations, and improving real-time customer interactions to enhance your customer relationships and drive sales.\nAnalytics\nAnalytics helps you better understand your data and make smart business decisions.\nDescriptive analytics summarize existing data to help you better understand current state or past activities. These analytics typically answer “What?” questions about your data.\nDiagnostic analytics use the output of descriptive analytics to identify patterns and outlier data. These analytics typically answer “Why?” questions about your data.\nPredictive analytics use historic data to attempt to anticipate future outcomes, such as the likelihood that a subscriber opens an email.\nPrescriptive analytics suggest future courses of action based on your existing data. These analytics typically answer “Should?” questions about your future actions.\nFunctional Capabilities\n\nBusiness-specific elements at the functional capabilities level are connected more directly to the customer’s experience and measured in terms of maturity. Successful implementation of functional capabilities depends heavily on implementation of the platform capabilities.\n\nThe retail life cycle typically crosses multiple engagement channels in the areas of Commerce, Communities, Sales, Service, and Marketing. Capabilities in the Operations area can help companies address new business needs related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nReview these commonly-required functional capabilities to identify strategic goals around which to focus your implementation.\n\nA Business Capability Maturity Assessment arranged by your Success Manager or Account Executive can help you determine which areas of your business can benefit from additional focus.\n\nMapping Platform Capabilities to Salesforce\n\nSpecific Salesforce products handle each of the needs identified at the platform capability level.\n\nIdentify gaps in your underlying capabilities by customizing this model to include other Salesforce products or third-party systems in your current technology stack. To explore the reference architecture specific to your business, contact your success manager or account team.\n\nTIP\n\nBusiness scenarios help you better understand your business capabilities and find solutions that support your business goals.\n\nLearn more about Salesforce products.\n\nRetail Industry Solution\nCommerce\nCommunities\nService\nSales\nWork.com\nMarketing\nData Cloud\nCustomer 360 Privacy Center\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Architectural Diagrams: Quick Look\nIndustry Blueprint for Retail\nSolution Architecture for Retail\nBusiness Scenarios for Retail\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
