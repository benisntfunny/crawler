An expansive selection of industry-specific, modular business processes are available through industry-specific APIs and integration apps that are deployed on MuleSoft CloudHub 1.0 and CloudHub 2.0. Unlike CloudHub 1.0, CloudHub 2.0 supports 12 global shared regions so that you can deploy your applications faster on a specific shared region. All shared regions are accessible to you if you have a global deployment entitlement. Otherwise, only those regions that are available to your organization are shown. If you deploy an integration on a shared space of CloudHub 2.0, you can choose to hide the value of the parameter on the MuleSoft’s Anypoint Runtime Manager.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: all editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo use Industry Integration Solutions:\t\n\nSalesforce Administrator\n\nAND\n\nMuleSoft Administrator\n\nThe integration apps are out-of-the-box templates that include prebuilt transformations that reduce the time and cost to go live. Connect your Salesforce and MuleSoft orgs using Industry Integration Solutions to deploy the integration apps. After deploying the apps in your MuleSoft instance in Salesforce, extend them in MuleSoft Anypoint Platform based on your business needs.\n\nUse the Industry APIs and Integrations with Industries Cloud to:\n\nImplement digital workflows and create seamless user experiences.\nInnovate with new apps by using industry-specific open APIs.\nGo live faster by using the prebuilt integrations.\nReduce costs by reusing the prebuilt integrations and APIs.\nUse IT assets for innovation instead of unlocking line of business (LOB) systems.\nRetrieve and process data for all subsystems more easily and fluidly.\n\nInclude the Industry API add-on—available at no additional cost—in your contract to use the Industry APIs with:\n\nCommunications Cloud\nEnergy and Utilities Cloud\nHealth Cloud\n\nIndustry integrations are available for:\n\nAutomotive Cloud\nCommunications Cloud\nConsumer Goods Cloud\nEnergy and Utilities Cloud\nFinancial Services Cloud\nHealth Cloud\nLoyalty Cloud\nManufacturing Cloud\nMedia Cloud\nEnable Access to Industry APIs\nTo enable access to Industry APIs, read and accept the terms and conditions of all the Industry Clouds that you are subscribed to. Enable access to multiple Industry clouds at once.\nEnable Access to Industry Integrations\nBefore you connect your Salesforce and MuleSoft instances, read and accept the terms and conditions of all the Industry Clouds that you are subscribed to. Enable access to multiple Industry clouds at once.\nConnect Your Salesforce and MuleSoft Instances\nSecurely connect your Salesforce and MuleSoft instances by logging in to your MuleSoft Anypoint Platform account or by using the credentials from a connected app in your MuleSoft instance.\nEnable Integrations\nAn integration is a pre-built app or a configurable example. Integrations simplify the business workflow implementation by allowing external systems to easily integrate with the Industries Cloud apps. An integration can depend on several other apps that are necessary to complete a business use case. For example, an integration app that syncs orders between SAP S/4 HANA and Salesforce Manufacturing Cloud has a related System API app to connect Salesforce to the SAP S/4 HANA system. Enabling an integration configures and deploys an instance of the integration and its dependent apps in your MuleSoft instance. Enable an integration multiple times to create multiple instances of the same integration.\nRe-enable a Failed Integration Instance\nRe-enable a failed instance of an integration.\nDelete an Integration Instance\nRemove an integration instance that you no longer need from your Salesforce org and MuleSoft Runtime Manager.\nUpdate Integrations to the Latest Version\nEnable integrations access to multiple Industry Clouds that you are subscribed to, without resetting the MuleSoft instance connection.\nReset MuleSoft Instance Connection\nResetting the MuleSoft instance connection disconnects the MuleSoft instance from Salesforce, and you’ll no longer be able to view the published integrations in your Salesforce org. After you reset, the deployed integrations are available only in the MuleSoft instance.\nDisable Access to Industry APIs and Integrations\nDisable the Industry APIs to remove access to them. Decline the terms and conditions to remove access to Integrations.\nUpdate Access to Integrations\nEnable integrations access to multiple Industry Clouds that you are subscribed to, without resetting the MuleSoft instance connection.\nExtend Your Integration App\nAfter deploying an integration app in your MuleSoft instance, you can extend the app in MuleSoft Anypoint Studio to meet your end-to-end business needs.\nView Integrations in Private Exchange\nIf you have developed and published your own integrations in your MuleSoft instance, you can view the integrations in Private Exchange.\nCommon Setup Errors\nSee the common errors that you can encounter during the Integration Solutions setup and the possible reasons and resolutions.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Healthcare API Developer Guide\nCommunications Cloud TM Forum API Developer Guide\nEnergy and Utilities Cloud API Developer Guide\nFinancial Services Cloud API Developer Guide\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
