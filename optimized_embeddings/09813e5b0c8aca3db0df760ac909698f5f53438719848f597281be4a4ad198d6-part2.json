To edit an active decision matrix version, disable the version first. You can edit decision matrix columns if only one version of a decision matrix exists and the version has fewer than 1,000 rows.\nSort and Filter Decision Matrix Rows\nYou can sort decision matrix rows in ascending or descending order of the values in a column. You can also filter rows based on column values.\nDownload Decision Matrix Data to a CSV File\nDownload a decision matrix as a CSV file to reuse the data to create another decision matrix or to modify a large volume of data before reuploading the CSV file.\nExport and Download Matrix Versions Exported to DMN Files\nExport decision matrix versions to Decision Model Notation (DMN) files from the Business Rules Engine app. The exported files can be downloaded from the record detail page of a decision matrix version. DMN is a standardized specification for writing business rules. With DMN files, you can reuse matrix versions created in Business Rules Engine in any tool that supports DMN files.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
