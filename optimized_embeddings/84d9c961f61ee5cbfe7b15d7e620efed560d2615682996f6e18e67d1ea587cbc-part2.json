If either of these are unchecked, the user will lose their Primary DC status.\n \n\nUnderstanding Permissions\n\nPrimary DCs have View All Cases by default for the selected Org.  A Primary DC can see all support cases logged against any Org they have permission to access. Primary DCs can enable View All Cases for other DCs in their org creating an \"Admin Designated Contact\" that has an additional permission along with the defaults listed below.  The Admin Designated Contact cannot manage DC users.\n\nDCs, where entitled, have the following permissions by default:\n\nView, edit, and escalate a case to Technical Support Management\nRequest an Expert Coaching Session\n\n \n\nPermission\tPrimary DC\tDC\tStandard User\nView Case (own)\tYes\tYes\tYes\nView All Cases\tYes\tNo\tNo\nCreate Case\tYes\tYes\tYes\nManage DCs\tYes\tNo\tNo\nView DC Permissions\tYes\tYes\tNo\nEdit DC Permissions\tYes\tNo\tNo\nExpert Coaching request\tYes\tYes\tNo\nEscalate Case\tYes\tYes\tYes\n\n \n\nView DC Permissions\n\nAny DC can view their own permissions.
