Configure various Chatter features and customize the Chatter experience for your users on the Chatter Settings page in Setup.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Contact Manager, Developer, and Database.com Editions\nTo access the Chatter Settings page in Setup, enter Chatter in the Quick Find box and select Chatter Settings.\nTo disable Chatter for your entire organization, deselect Enable in the Chatter Settings section.\nChatter Group Settings\nUse Chatter group settings to configure group features like group archiving, records in groups, and unlisted groups.\nSet the Format of Timestamps on Case Feed Posts\nIn case feeds show users a relative timestamp on new posts, like 10m ago, or an absolute timestamp, like January 7, 2020 at 12:15PM. Comments and replies are also shown with relative timestamps.\nConvert Character Combinations into Emoticons in the Feed\nEmoticons let your users enter character combinations in their posts and comments to create expressions.\nLet Users Set Out-of-Office Messages in Chatter\nLet your users schedule and customize an out-of-office message, and place it next to their name in Chatter. You can enable or disable this feature in Setup, under Chatter Settings. Setting an out-of-office message is available only in Lightning Experience.\nCustomer Invitations\nLet users invite customers to the private groups that they own or manage. Customers are users outside of your company's email domains. They have limited Chatter access and can see only the groups that they're invited to. They can interact only with members of those groups.\nCoworker Invitations\nLet Salesforce users invite coworkers without Salesforce licenses to Chatter. Invited users can access Chatter people, profiles, groups, and files, but they can’t see record data unless they have a Salesforce license.\nEnable Add Actions in the Chatter Publisher\nIn Salesforce Classic, before you can add global actions to the Chatter publisher, you must first enable the Actions in the Publisher feature in Chatter Settings. Actions add functionality to the Chatter publisher and let your users do more in Salesforce across every device.\nFeed Post and Comments Editing Overview\nWith feed post editing, users can edit their own feed posts. Record owners can also edit any post on records they own, no matter who created the post.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Chatter\nTopics Privacy\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
