Prepare your business, employees, and facilities. Respond to major events, such as the current COVID-19 crisis, with the apps and services in Work.com.\n\nThe Work.com solution contains many products. Work.com was initially released on June 1, 2020.\n\nTIP We list new features and behaviors here as they're initially released in the latest package or Salesforce instance. The availability of these changes depends on your Salesforce instance and the deployment of new Salesforce releases and package updates to your org, which can take several days or weeks. Find your org’s instance in Setup on the Company Information page, then go to status.salesforce.com to check your instance’s version or maintenance plan. And, in Setup, check the Installed Package page to see which packages are in your org.\nIMPORTANT In the Spring ’21 release and later, Community Cloud is called Experience Cloud. The new name better reflects the many types of connected digital experiences you can create—including portals, websites, help centers, forums, and mobile apps.\n\nSo what's different? Terminology, for starters. Whether you’re creating a forum, portal, or any other type of digital experience, at the most basic level, you’re building an online site. So, for example, instead of saying community, which primarily connotes a forum where people interact with one another, we now use the term site or Experience Cloud site. For details, see the Salesforce Spring '21 Release Notes.\n\nThese changes affect all Salesforce orgs using Community Cloud. Winter '21 production orgs running Work.com still use the old Community Cloud names and labels. Spring '21 sandboxes running Work.com use the new Experience Cloud names and labels. We'll update the Work.com documentation to reflect the Experience Cloud names when production orgs start running the Spring '21 release. In the meantime, if you accidentally enter Community in the Quick Find box in an org running Spring '21, we automatically display the menu renamed Digital Experiences instead. We know that old habits are hard to break!\n\nWorkplace Command Center\nWorkplace Command Center helps you monitor return-to-work readiness and decide when to safely bring people back to the workplace. It gives executives, business operations managers, and admins a single view of their employees’ readiness to work and the company’s readiness to support workers. When employees return to work, keep everyone safe by monitoring employee health and location readiness. Workplace Command Center comes with Employee Wellness Check components, Operations Feed, and Global COVID-19 Tracker.\nWellness Check\nIn a crisis, assess the well-being of your team with Wellness Check. Send surveys to your employees, students, or other stakeholders to get data about how ready they are to return on-site. Then visualize results for your team as a whole and across multiple locations to make smart, data-informed decisions about reopening.\nEmployee Workspace\nEmployee Workspace is a central digital hub for employees to access tools and resources they need no matter where they work. Provide an integrated experience with Employee Workspace and enable your employees to connect, communicate, and collaborate, and succeed in today’s new normal.\nEmployee Concierge\nGive your employees the ability to answer questions and solve issues. With Employee Concierge, add a searchable knowledge base and a support ticketing system to your Employee Service site. Designate Knowledge Authors to write articles and IT Agents to manage support tickets. Employee Concierge includes a custom Salesforce app for IT Agents to respond to and resolve tickets.\nEmployee Concierge Bot\nGive your employees concise answers to quick questions with a chatbot integrated into Employee Concierge.\nIT Service Center\nDrive proactive resolutions and faster remediation of IT cases with the IT Service Center. Enable IT Agents to accelerate case resolution by using AI-powered productivity tools and real-time endpoint visibility and control powered by Tanium.\nHR Service Center\nConnect and simplify your employee HR management system and easily build processes for employee onboarding with HR Service Center.\nService Catalog\nA service catalog is a portfolio of the products and services you provide to your employees. Employee Service Catalog helps you turn your employees’ requests for those products and services into approved and documented orders.\nShift Management\nShift Management for Work.com streamlines the process of getting your employees back to work safely. Model the relationships and occupancy of your workplace sites, facilities, and resources. Then incorporate new requirements and policies to plan for how many people can be on-premises at a time. Let your team know when to show up to avoid crowding in common areas such as lobbies and elevators.\nWorkplace Strategy Planner\nEvaluate the risks and priorities of operating each of your workplace locations. With Workplace Strategy Planner, add COVID-19 public health data, government guidelines, and business priorities to give more context to the current conditions at your workplace locations. Use the interactive dashboard to analyze the data in aggregate and to help you decide when to open or close a location.\nEmergency Response Management\nUse Emergency Response Management products and solutions to serve residents, communities, and agencies when they need it most. Provide access to emergency information, deliver care to those affected, and allocate resources and services with more speed and efficacy than ever before.\nCustomer-Facing Apps\nOur customer-facing Work.com apps help you reestablish customer trust and jumpstart business growth. Our Queue Management app helps you regulate customer flow with a digital wait-list for patrons and occupancy oversight tools. Broadcast Messaging keeps customers informed with notifications and automatic responses. Digital Trust Cards give your customers peace of mind by identifying the safety protocols you're taking to safely reopen and operate your business.\nChanges to Standard Objects, Records, and Metadata Types\nHere you can find new features or changes to Work.com standard objects.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Work.com Learning Map\nPromote Wellness and Productivity with Work.com\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
