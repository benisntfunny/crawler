Your users already rely on notes to stay organized. With enhanced Notes in Lightning Experience, everyone can create better notes faster from anywhere.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, the Notes & Attachments related list is an outdated version of the new Notes. In Lightning Experience, enhanced Notes offers more versatility and is optimized for Lightning Experience. Users can:\n\nHighlight important details with rich text formatting, like bold and italic (1).\nOrganize content with bulleted and numbered steps (2).\nAdd clarity and memorability by embedding images (3).\nKeep sensitive notes or selectively share with the appropriate people (4).\nShare notes with people or groups to increase collaboration (5).\nRelate a note to multiple records to expand the visibility and impact of important information (6).\n\nAdd enhanced notes in areas throughout an app to improve your org’s productivity. Include note-taking actions in the Lightning Experience header, the highlights panel on records, and Lightning app utility bars. Add the Notes item to the navigation bar of your Lightning apps to give users access to the Notes home page. Manage all notes on the Notes home page, whether they’re related to records or not.\n\nNext Steps: Add Notes Throughout Lightning Experience\n\nBefore you add notes to Lightning Experience, make sure that users can access their notes and attachments in the new interface.\n\nEnable Notes.\nReview the Magic Mover for Notes and Attachments documentation under Customization Guides. Before using the Magic Mover, add the Files related list to page layouts.\nAdd the Notes Related List to Page Layouts.\nAdd a Utility Bar to Lightning Apps and include Notes in your footer.\nAdd the Notes home page to your navigation bar.\nFind out more about working with Notes in Lightning Experience.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
