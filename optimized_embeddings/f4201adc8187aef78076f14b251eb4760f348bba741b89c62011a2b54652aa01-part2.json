Safety Cloud provides Health Verification from a Health Card QR code.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions.\n\nSafety Cloud provides automated verification from a Health Card QR code.\n\nUsers can share SMART Health Cards for verification by:\n\nSelecting Health Card QR code from the Health Verification form and uploading an image of the card, in the same way a user uploads an image of their vaccination card.\n\nPresenting the card to the Visualforce barcode scanner page on a verifier’s device, for point-of-entry verification.\n\nUnlike COVID-19 Vaccination Record Cards, SMART Health Cards embed health-related data in a QR code, which can’t be read and analyzed manually by an agent. Instead, Safety Cloud extracts health data from the QR code automatically and analyzes and verifies it programmatically.\n\nThis diagram illustrates health verification processing based on how the user submits their SMART Health Card.\n\nWhen a card holder submits their SMART Health Card for verification by presenting it to the Visualforce Scanner page or by uploading an image of it, Safety Cloud extracts and analyzes the QR code and creates a Health Card record.\n\nThe newly created Health Card record is linked to the associated Health Verification record and has a Verification Status = New.\n\nDifferentiating Between Vaccination Data and Laboratory Test Data\n\nWhen Safety Cloud extracts the QR Code from the SMART Health Card, it distinguishes between vaccination data and laboratory report data.\n\nHealth Cards containing vaccination data have a fhirBundle. It has one Patient resource, which contains the card holder’s details, and one or more Immunization resources, which contain their vaccine details. In this case, for the payload, Safety Cloud creates a Health Verification record that includes the related Health Card record with the related Dose record.\n\nHealth Cards containing Laboratory report data have a fhirBundle. It has one Patient resource, which contains the card holder’s details, and one or more Observation resources, which contain their test reports. In this case, for the payload, Safety Cloud creates a Health Verification record that includes the related Health Card record and related Lab Result record.\n\nFor an example of the complete JWS payload data, see fhir-shc-vaccination-ig/examples/Scenario3Bundle-jws-payload-expanded.json.\n\nPoint-of-Entry Health Verification\nSMART Health Card holders can scan their SMART Health Card for point-of-entry health verification. Safety Cloud provides an out-of-the-box Visualforce barcode scanner page that can be installed on any browser.\nConfigure the Visualforce Barcode Scanner Page for Point-of-Entry Verification\nSafety Cloud comes with a Visualforce page that you can use to scan SMART Health Card QR codes. You can load the Visualforce page on any browser. After it’s scanned, the QR code’s payload is extracted and verified by the Safety Cloud health card verification service.\nEnable the Known Issuers Directory\nAs an admin, you can enable the Known Issuer Directories Setup feature to import an up-to-date list of known SMART Health Card issuers. The data from the Known Issuers directory helps Safety Cloud determine whether the SMART Health Card shared by a card holder is valid and credible.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
