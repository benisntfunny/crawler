Place the prompt at one of nine different locations on a page.\n\nFor example, show a prompt to let users know they can pin a favorite list view, which helps boost their productivity.\n\nTargeted Prompt\n\nHighlight a specific element on a page by pointing to the element with an arrow and graying out the rest of the page. Select the specific element that you want to target and position the prompt at one of 12 positions relative to the element. You can also target specific fields on a record page, dynamic form, or Create window.\n\nOr, let Salesforce determine the best location for the prompt depending on the current page configuration.\n\nFor example, show a targeted prompt on the Details tab of the Contact record page.\n\nDocked Prompt\n\nDrive feature adoption and help guide users through more complicated tasks. Embed images, videos, and step-by-step directions in a larger-sized prompt that stays available for users.\n\nFor example, show a docked prompt that includes a video to let users know about changes to the layout of the account page.\n\nComparison of Prompt Types\n\nTo help you select the right type of in-app guidance, compare supported features and environments.\n\nCONSIDERATION\tFLOATING PROMPT\tTARGETED PROMPT\tDOCKED PROMPT\nLightning Experience supported\t\t\t\nExperience Cloud sites supported\t\t\t\nRich text supported\t\t\t\n\nSupports more rich text options than floating and targeted prompts, including color, links, and list formatting.\n\n\nImage\t\t\t\nEmbedded video\t\t\t\nOptional Action button\t\t\t\nOptional Dismiss button\t\t\t\nSnooze icon\t\t\t\nBehavior when a user leaves the page\tDisappears\tDisappears\tRemains available.

Too much information can overwhelm users. Review the writing tips in Tips for Writing Effective In-App Guidance.\n\nBecause floating prompts and targeted prompts take up a small area of the page, you can set up a schedule for the prompt so that users see it again. See Considerations for Creating In-App Guidance.\n\nWalkthrough\n\nProvide guided, in-context training and onboarding on a single page or across multiple pages. Connect up to 10 prompts in a step-by-step, guided experience. Users can see their progress through the walkthrough at each prompt, such as Step 1 out of 4.\n\nTIP To keep users engaged and encourage completion, we recommend that you limit a walkthrough to 5 steps. Consider breaking up a longer walkthrough into two shorter walkthroughs.\nIn Lightning Experience, walkthroughs can have a mix of all prompt types. We recommend docked prompts only for the final step so that you can include more information and calls to action.\nIn supported Experience Cloud sites, walkthroughs can have only floating prompts.\n\nFor example, show a walkthrough that introduces new sales team members to a specific feature.\n\nPrompts in a walkthrough behave differently compared to standalone prompts.\n\nEach prompt includes a progress button, labeled Next, except for the final prompt, where the button is labeled Finish.\nThe final prompt provides an optional action link instead of an Action button.\n\nA walkthrough can include prompts across multiple pages, even pages that only open when a user completes a required action. For example, create a walkthrough that shows users how to create a lead. Add prompts that highlight fields in the New Lead window. Then, add a final prompt that only appears on the lead record page after the user completes all the fields in the New Lead window and saves.\n\nNOTE In this example, the Next button is unavailable in the final prompt that's associated with the window until the user completes a required action in the window. This pattern ensures that users complete a requirement before the walkthrough advances to the next prompt on a different page.\nSEE ALSO\nConsiderations for Creating In-App Guidance\nTips for Writing Effective In-App Guidance\nLimitations for In-App Guidance in Experience Cloud Sites\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
