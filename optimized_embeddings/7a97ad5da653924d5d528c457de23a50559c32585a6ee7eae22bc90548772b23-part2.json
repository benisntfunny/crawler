A streamlined campaign experience brings contacts and content together, while flows enhance and automate your daily tasks.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Starter and Pro Suite Editions. Your edition determines the options you have.\nGetting Started\n\nEmail marketing must meet privacy regulations, so some setup is required to get going with a marketing campaign. Take care of these quick tasks, and then it’s on to the fun stuff!\n\nTo access these settings, click  and then click Open Advanced Settings. To find the relevant pages, start typing in the Quick Find box.\n\nJOB TYPE\tLOCATION\tDETAILS\nRequired\t\n\nBusiness Details in Quick Settings\n\nCompany Information in Advanced Setup\n\n\tEnter your physical business address. This address is connected to the Physical Address merge field, which must appear in every promotional email to meet CAN-SPAM requirements.\nRequired\tOrganization-Wide Addresses\tAdd at least one email address to use as the sender in the From field of your emails.\nRequired\tLeads or Contacts\tImport your leads or contacts with their marketing consent details.\nOptional\tMy Domain\tSpecify the subdomain to use in the URLs for creative assets and files you save in the Content area. This subdomain is also used in the login URL for your Salesforce Starter or Pro Suite app.\nOptional\tEinstein for Marketing\tChoose whether to use AI with Salesforce Starter or Pro Suite. When you activate Einstein Send Time Optimization, data from the Salesforce global model supplements your Salesforce data to boost email engagement.\nTIP The Company Information page also includes a Usage-Based Entitlements table, which contains allocation details about how many emails you can send. Review this table periodically, especially when scheduling emails for a future date. When usage is high, any user with the System Administrator profile can purchase bundles of email sends from the Billing and Purchases page.\nCampaigns Are Key\n\nThe Marketing app provides streamlined access to powerful platform tools from other parts of Salesforce. You get power with less complexity, and the campaign record helps guide you as you build a marketing plan.\n\nLet’s look at the parts of a campaign.\n\nAudience: To target email recipients, create a segment. To build a segment, select criteria from object fields, such as an account ZIP code or last activity date. A segment’s population is dynamic and always gets updated immediately before an email is sent. \nContent: Build emails in the Salesforce CMS content builder. Drag components into the layout, and then edit text and insert images. To maintain a consistent style for your emails, select a brand. Use preview and test options to make sure your content looks great before you launch. \nSchedule: You can choose to launch campaign content immediately or schedule it for later. Use Einstein Send Time Optimization to automatically send each message when its recipient is most likely to open it.\nChoosing a Starting Point\n\nInstead of building a campaign from scratch, you have options for campaigns that make it easy to send one email or build a series of emails.\n\nA campaign starts with a flow, which visualizes and automates multistep processes and connects data and publishing pipelines behind the scenes. Campaign flows come configured with one or more elements to get you started. You can add and edit flows from the campaign record. You can also add, move, and remove elements from each campaign flow in Flow Builder to meet your needs. See How Campaigns and Flows Work Together.\n\nAbout Object Relationships\n\nAll your marketing work is connected to a campaign and one or more flows. Flows drive email sending and automation and bring together your audience, content, and scheduling details. These things are accessible from a campaign record.\n\nSome objects have one-to-one relationships, while others can support one-to-many.\n\nA campaign is related to one or more flows, one segment, and one or more emails.\nA flow is related to one campaign.\nYou can use the same email in multiple campaigns.\nYou can use the same segment in multiple campaigns.\nTracking Success\n\nMonitor the success of your emails so you can set marketing goals and refine campaigns. Salesforce Starter and Pro Suite come with engagement reports, dashboards, and folders to get you started. To share reports and dashboards, a user with the System Administrator profile can grant users access to engagement folders from the Browse tab in Analytics.\n\nEXAMPLE At Ursa Major Solar, Erin and Lance are working on plans for the Alternative Energies Expo. To engage attendees beyond their booth, they decide to host a mixer for recent leads and contacts. They develop an email invitation and boost engagement with Einstein Send Time Optimization. Check out Trailhead to see how they do it.\nEXAMPLE After the Alternative Energies Expo, the team is back in the office and hoping to follow up with the new people they met. Working with customer pros Lincoln and Ada, they develop a timely email series to educate and nurture the people who expressed an interest in solar technology. Check out Trailhead to see how they do it.\nMarketing Considerations for Salesforce Starter and Pro Suite\nThe marketing tools and objects that you use in Salesforce Starter and Pro Suite have some nuances to understand.\nConsent Management in Salesforce Starter and Pro Suite\nBefore you send promotional emails, make sure that you’re in compliance with regulations such as CAN-SPAM. Also, consider data syncing and timing when updating records and sending messages.\nMarketing Segments\nWhen you target a group within your audience, we call that a segment. In Salesforce Starter and Pro Suite, you build a segment by applying filter criteria, such as the person’s location or account name. Filter criteria are based on data objects that store information about your leads, contacts, and unified individuals.\nSegment Examples\nTo get started quickly with segments, try a combination of commonly used fields. For best results, verify field values on corresponding records, and copy and paste those values into the segment canvas.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
