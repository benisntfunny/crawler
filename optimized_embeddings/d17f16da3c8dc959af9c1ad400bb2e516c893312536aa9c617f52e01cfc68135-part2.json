Install and Perform Initial Setup\n\nAfter installation of the connector package, enable CPQ B2B Commerce Connector Settings for SKU (Product) and Pricing Sync records.\n\nNavigate to Setup > Custom Metadata Types > Connector Sync Config > Manage\n\nUpdate Page Layouts using the Product and Pricing Sync Instructions of the installation guide.\n\n2. Create Custom Fields on Pricing and Product Objects\n\nThe following tables show the recommended core metadata CPQ and B2B Commerce fields. They represent a 1-to-1 mapping with the SKU and Pricing Sync Process. Include other custom fields for more business requirements.\n\nProduct Fields\nPRODUCT2\tCC PRODUCT\n\n\nCC_Quantity_Per_Unit__c\n\nCC_Start_Date__c\n\nCC_End_Date__c\n\nCC_Long_Description__c\n\nCC_Storefront__c\n\nCC_ProductType__c\n\nCC_LastSyncDate__c\n\n\t\n\nProduct_Id__c\n\nProduct_Type__c\n\nPricing Book Fields\nPRICE BOOK\tCC PRICE LIST\n\n\nCC_Start_Date__c\n\nCC_End_Date__c\n\nCC_Storefront__c\n\nCC_LastSyncDate__c\n\n\t\n\nPriceBook_Id__c\n\nPricing Book Entry Fields\nPRICEBOOKENTRY\tCC PRICE LIST ITEM\n\n\nCC_Price_List_Id__c (*Formula)\n\nCC_Product__c (*Formula)\n\nCC_Start_Date__c\n\nCC_End_Date__c\n\nCC_Item_Type__c\n\nCC_Min_Qty__c\n\nCC_Max_Qty__c\n\nCC_Reoccuring_Price__c\n\nCC_LastSyncDate__c\n\n\t\n\nPriceBook_Entry_Id__c\n\nPrice_Book_Id__c (*Formula)\n\nCustom Field Notes:\n\nCC_LastSyncDate__c;\n\nUse this field for managing Data Events that link data from one cloud to the other. Add this field on all source CPQ Objects mapped to a sync process with the Connector for reporting and monitoring.\n\nProduct2\n\nCC_ProductType__c\n\n*Picklist for Commerce Products, Simple Product, Tier Priced Product, Product Bundle, Kit, Dynamic Kit, Percent of Total Product.\n\nCC Product\n\nUse an extra custom attribute “Product_Type__c” to capture the value passed. Track product types that aren’t supported B2B Commerce out-of-box, such as Percent of Total.\n\nPriceBookEntry\n\nCC_Price_List_Id__c\n\n*Formula field links to CC Price List based on Price Book Id.\n\nCC_Item_Type__c\n\n*Field type of pricing (tiered, simple). If this value is “tiered,”publish the Discount Schedule associated with this Product as tier pricing on the Price List Entry.\n\nCC_Recurring_Price__c\n\n*Subscription field attribute captures support for recurring billing (typically used for subscriptions).\n\nManaging Tier Pricing for B2B Commerce Products\n\nPublish the product and pricing details for B2B Tier Priced Products. Set up the product in CPQ with a Discount Schedule matching the Tier Pricing structure.\n\nStamp the value “CC_Item_Type__c” on the object “Price Book Entry” as Tiered.\n\nUse a sync job to look at the Price Book Entry for this value. If it's set up as “Tiered”, publish the Discount Schedule associated with this Product. Publish as JSON value on the attribute “ccrz__PricingTiers__c” related to “CC Price List Entry” object.\n\n3. Supplement the Installed Package CPQ B2B Mapping Custom Metadata\n\nFollow this path: Setup > Custom Metadata > CPQ B2B Mapping > Manage Records.\n\nCreate a metadata record to manage the field sync for the SKU Process. For example, the Connector process that uses the mapping record logic.\n\nSelect the source object from the picklist options. Lead with CPQ objects first for SKU and Pricing process types with destination objects of CC Commerce.\n\nSource Field picklist maps the from field to the Destination Field picklist, including the custom fields created in step one.\n\nChoose the Field-Mapping Service Class. Select the option that matches your technical implementation setup and process.\n\n4. Review Data Between CPQ and B2B Commerce\n\nDetermine the need for data load insert or update to CC Commerce Product and Pricing Objects.\n\nTest Batch and Sync to ensure that the setup carried over expected synchronized field sets.\n\nReview the CC Commerce Product Index. Manually run and schedule future Product Index.\n\nRelated Content\n\t\n\nReview earlier steps in this solution.\n\nWorkflow\nDesign Considerations\nConnector\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
