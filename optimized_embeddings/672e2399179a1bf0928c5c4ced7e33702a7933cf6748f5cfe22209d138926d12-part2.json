Promotions can play a significant role in increasing product sales and generating business revenues. Promotions help loyalty program members get a better return on their investment with attractive offers in the form of vouchers or loyalty points.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Developer, and Unlimited Editions\nAvailable in: Orgs that have the B2C - Loyalty, B2C - Loyalty Plus, B2B - Loyalty, Loyalty Management - Growth, or Loyalty Management - Advanced license enabled\n\nPromotions give you the ability to define the right offers for various customer segments at the right time. Promotions can be of these types:\n\nStandard Promotions: Promotions that provide immediate benefits to members. These promotions are based on a single transaction and don’t require member behavior tracking for promotion execution. For example, to clear out stock before winter, you offer 20% off for jacket purchases on October 25.\n\nCumulative Promotions: Promotions that reward members based on their longer-term behaviors, such as participation frequency or the amount of money spent to qualify for a reward. Cumulative promotion is based on multiple customer transactions and requires member behavior tracking for the promotion execution. For example, to boost overall sales, your company instructs all stores in a store group to offer 1000 credit points to consumers. The points are credited only on purchases above $1000 during the month of January.\n\nJoint Promotions: Promotions involving one or more partners who jointly contribute and engage their members better and capture partner liability at the promotion level. For example, Cloud Kicks and NTO contribute 40% and 60% respectively for a joint promotion. The liability is also 40% for Cloud Kicks and 60% for NTO as liability distribution is based on contribution percentage. When a new loyalty program member uses this promotion for a partner’s products or services and accrues 1,000 points, Cloud Kicks is liable for 400 points and NTO is liable for 600 points.\n\nJoint promotion is available only for Expanded Partner Management .\n\nIn Loyalty Management, promotions use Data Cloud or Salesforce Reports to identify members for promotion and use Marketing Cloud to send the campaigns to the members.\n\nNOTE Loyalty Management and Data Cloud must be installed in the same Salesforce org.\nExplore and Learn\n\nWatch this video to understand how to add rewards for your loyalty program.\n\nIf you aren’t able to watch the video in full screen, open the video on a new tab:  Add a Loyalty Program’s Rewards.\n\nGlobal Promotions Management\nWith Global Promotions Management, marketing managers and loyalty program managers can design both pricing and non-pricing promotions. They can design the promotions to run as part of the company’s loyalty program or outside the loyalty program as part of the company’s 360-degree marketing strategy. Companies can use Global Promotions Management to run granular promotions with in-built limits and promotion launch emails. Also, your company’s customers get a real-time view of the promotions that are applicable for their cart and can apply the eligible promotions of their choice during checkout.\nQuick Promotions\nConfigure a promotion, its eligibility, and rewards in four steps using the Quick Promotion Wizard. Loyalty program managers can use the wizard to get a promotion up and running within a few minutes.\nCreate a Promotion\nYou can create loyalty promotions and use reward vouchers and loyalty points to acquire new customers or engage existing customers. You can define the type of the promotion, the loyalty program associated with the promotion, whether enrollment is required for the promotion, and the promotion’s start and end dates. You can also define how to reward the members upon fulfilling the requirement of promotion by vouchers or credit points, and the status of the promotion.\nAdd Partner Products\nYou can associate products or product categories that are applied to a particular promotion.\nSet Up Promotions with Data Cloud\nTo identify and create the right promotions for the right customers, promotions integrate with Data Cloud to create segments. Segments help you understand, analyze, and target your customers. The segments are activated to Marketing Cloud for promotional campaigns. The Marketing Cloud’s Data Extension lets you admit contacts into a journey in a batch. And the Journey Builder lets you efficiently create and track customer journeys through a series of interactions with your brand.\nSet Up Promotions With Campaigns\nYou can set up and manage promotions with campaign members when you don’t have Data Cloud in your Salesforce org. Use campaigns to identify the right customer segments and send promotional campaigns to these customers. The segments and members are created using Salesforce Reports. Use data extensions with loyalty data and send promotional campaigns to efficiently create and track customer journeys through Journey Builder.\nGenerate Targeted Member Lists for Promotions with Actionable Lists\nLoyalty program managers can work with admins to create a unique list of the members who are eligible for a specific promotion. The admin can use Actionable Segmentation to create actionable lists for each promotion consisting of the promotion’s target member audience. You can add the target audience provided by the actionable list as members of the promotion’s campaign. You can also create actionable lists for finding members who are eligible to be included in bulk service recovery actions such as issuing vouchers, crediting points, and upgrading tier.\nApply Promotions and Update Members' Progress\nWhen processing transaction journals, use Flow actions to find promotions that are applicable for a transaction and the transaction's associated member. Use the Apply Promotion template flow to apply selected promotions to members. The flow template can credit points or issue a voucher.\nPromotion Calendar\nLoyalty program managers can visualize all promotions of a loyalty program on the promotion calendar. The promotion calendar lists events, so program managers can check whether promotions are planned during company and social events. On the calendar, program managers can select a date range and view the active and inactive promotions available during the period. Program managers can view promotions in groups or filter promotions to easily find the promotions that they’re looking for. The promotion calendar helps program managers easily find white spaces where new promotions can be added. And, view the details of multiple promotions in a single view helping you identify duplicates.\nClone Promotions\nLoyalty program managers can clone their seasonal or repetitive promotions. Instead of creating a promotion from scratch, loyalty program managers can clone a similar promotion, edit the cloned promotion if necessary, and activate the new promotion. Loyalty program managers can clone promotions that are created either using the standard Promotion page layout or using the Quick Promotion guided flow.\nView and Track Member Promotions\nView the promotions offered to a member in the loyalty program. For Cumulative type promotions, you can track the member's process towards achieving the promotion's target usage.\nOffer Promotions in Real Time with Marketing Cloud Personalization\nUse Marketing Cloud Personalization (formerly Interaction Studio) to provide targeted promotions to members in real time. Configure your Salesforce org and Marketing Cloud org to ensure that your promotion-related data is available in Marketing Cloud Personalization. This configuration requires you to create segments by using Data Cloud.\nFlow Actions for Promotions\nUse the three Flow actions to find eligible promotions for members and track members' progress toward availing cumulative promotions.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
