The libraries home page has two tabs: Shared Content, which provides information about shared libraries, and My Private Files, which contains information about your private library.\n\nShared Content\n\nThe Shared Content tab on the libraries home page contains the following sections:\n\nMy Libraries\n\nThis section lists all the libraries to which you have access. Click a library name to view details about that library or click Browse to view a list of all the content in the library. Click the New button to create libraries, add users to a library, or assign library permissions to users.\n\nFeatured Content\n\nThis section lists the five pieces of content in your libraries most recently designed as “featured.” Featured content receives a higher priority than similar content in search results; for example, if 100 files contain the search criteria term sales asset, any featured files with that term appear at the top of the search results list. To see all featured content, click Show All. To toggle a piece of content's feature status on or off, go to its content details page.\n\nTop Content\n\nThis section includes lists that summarize content activity across all your libraries. Each list sorts content according to specific criteria. Within a list, click a file icon to download content or click a title to open the associated content details page. In the Top Content section you can choose from the following categories:\n\nPublication Date—This content is sorted in descending order according to the most recent publication date. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the published files, Web links, and Google docs.\nNum Downloads—This content is sorted in descending order according to the highest number of downloads. The bar graphic indicates how one record compares to another. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the downloaded content.\nRating—This content is sorted in descending order according to the highest number of thumbs-up votes. Green and red in the bar graphic represent positive and negative votes, respectively. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the content with votes.\nNum Comments—This content is sorted in descending order according to the highest number of viewer comments. The bar graphic indicates how one record compares to another. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the content with associated comments.\nPopular Tags\n\nThis section, commonly referred to as a “tag cloud,” shows you how the content in your libraries has been labeled. Tags are descriptive terms assigned during upload or revision that help classify and organize content. Click a tag name to view search results containing all the files, Web links, and Google docs with that tag. The tag names increase in size within the tag cloud according to popularity, meaning that the largest tags have been assigned to the most content. You can choose to sort the tags alphabetically or by popularity. The tag cloud contains the 30 most popular tags.\n\nRecent Activity\n\nThis section is a snapshot of activity within your libraries. It shows the most recent files, Web links, and Google docs to receive comments, votes, or subscriptions. Featured content and newly published content are also included, but new versions of existing content, archived content, and deleted content do not appear in the Recent Activity section. Use the Older and Newer buttons to scroll through records. The Recent Activity section contains a maximum of 100 records.\n\nMost Active Contributors\n\nThis section shows the authors who have published content into your libraries most frequently. The names increase in size according to activity, so the largest names are the authors who have contributed the most content.\n\nMy Private Files\n\nThe My Private Files tab on the libraries home page is your private library. When you upload or create content and do not select a public library, your content is stored in your private library. You can publish content to a public library at any time or leave content in your private library indefinitely. Content in your private library can be assembled in content packs. It can also be sent to leads and contacts outside your organization using the content delivery feature. The My Private Files tab has these sections:\n\nPrivate Library\n\nIf you choose the Save to my private library option when publishing a file, Web link, content pack, or Google doc, your content is saved here. You can publish or delete files from this list or click the file's name to view its content details page. The following options that are available on the content details page for shared content are not available for private-library content: tagging, rating, subscribing, tracking downloads, tracking subscriptions, or using custom fields. If you publish a file from the Private Library list and click Cancel during the publishing process, your file is deleted.\n\nUpload Interrupted\n\nIf an error occurs when you upload a new file, for example your browser crashes or your session times out, the file you were uploading is saved here. Click Publish to publish the file to a public library or save it to your private library. If you click Cancel on the Save or Publish Content dialog, your file is deleted.\n\nRevision Upload Interrupted\n\nIf an error occurs when you upload a new version of a file, the file you were uploading is saved here. Users can continue to access the original version. Click Publish to publish the file to a public library or save it to your private library. If you click Cancel on the Save or Publish Content dialog, your file is deleted.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
