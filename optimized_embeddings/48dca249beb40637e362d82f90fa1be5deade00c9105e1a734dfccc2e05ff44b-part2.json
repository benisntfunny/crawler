The reference architecture helps communicate the vision and strategy of a solution to business executives and stakeholders. Learn with Trailhead.\n\nConceptualize business success in each of three categories of capabilities: Foundational, Platform, and Functional.\n\nOur reference architecture presents Platform and Functional capabilities. Each layer contains a representative subset of systems or capabilities that are most relevant for Retail Banking industry. It doesn’t list all possible systems or capabilities.\n\nPlatform Capabilities\n\nThese components form the underlying technology base for achieving your goals. Each layer in the platform builds on top of the next. B2B and B2C systems typically rely on these elements.\n\nData Sources\nData sources are systems that create, collect, and manage various types of data. These systems can act as systems of record. They’re often purpose-built to handle particular functionality and data requirements. Some address general system needs.\nIntegrations\nIntegrations include tools and routes that connect systems of record with each other or with higher-level experiences. Integrations are varied tools, such as APIs that connect separate systems, single sign-on services to manage customer identity across different systems, and customer data platforms to segment customers.\nAnalytics and Intelligence\nAnalytics helps you better understand your data and make smart business decisions. Smart automation like machine learning and AI helps you optimize your use of customer data. The intelligence layer serves functions like delivering actionable customer insights, personalized product recommendations, and improving real-time customer interactions to enhance your customer relationships and drive sales.\nPlatform Enablers\nPlatform Enablers are a set of capabilities that enable your business to track customers as they interact with your bank based on their point in the customer journey. The capabilities represent the day zero to lifetime engagement with a customer and support internal employees as they onboard these customers.\nFunctional Capabilities\n\nBusiness-specific elements at the functional capabilities level are connected more directly to the customer’s experience and measured in terms of maturity. Successful implementation of functional capabilities depends heavily on implementation of the platform capabilities.\n\nThe retail bank’s lifecycle typically crosses multiple engagement channels in the areas of Marketing, Sales, Onboarding, Servicing, and Growing. Digital engagements and self-serve channels are necessary for the companies to address new business needs related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTo identify strategic goals around which to focus your implementation, review these frequently required functional capabilities.\n\nA Business Capability Maturity Assessment arranged by your Success Manager or Account Executive can help you determine which areas of your business can benefit from more focus.\n\nMapping Platform Capabilities to Salesforce\n\nSpecific Salesforce products handle each of the needs identified at the platform capability level.\n\nIdentify gaps in your underlying capabilities by customizing this model to include other Salesforce products or third-party systems in your current technology stack. To explore the reference architecture specific to your business, contact your success manager or account team.\n\nTIP\n\nBusiness Scenarios help you better understand your business capabilities and find solutions that support your business goals.\n\nLearn more about Salesforce products.\n\nFinancial Services Cloud\nCPQ\nMulesoft\nCommerce\nExperience Cloud\nService\nSales\nAnalytics\nWork.com\nMarketing\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Architectural Diagrams: Quick Look\nIndustry Blueprint for Retail Banking\nSolution Architecture for Retail Banking\nBusiness Scenarios for Retail Banking\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
