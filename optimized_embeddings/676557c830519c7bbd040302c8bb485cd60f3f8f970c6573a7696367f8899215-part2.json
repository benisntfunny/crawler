You can apply unique record filters and data transformation rules to each object on a policy.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Developer, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions. Requires the Privacy Center license.\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create, edit, and schedule Data Management Policies:\tManage Privacy Center Policies\n\nIf you add multiple objects to a policy, the objects are processed in the order that they appear on the policy details page, under Active Objects. You can adjust the order in which objects are executed using the Up or Down arrow buttons.\n\nIf a referenced object or field gets removed from your org, Salesforce updates your policy automatically so that it no longer references the missing object or field. In some cases, a missing field can cause an entire object to be removed from your policy. This behavior is designed as a safety precaution to reduce the risk of unintentionally modifying or deleting records.\n\nComplete these tasks for each object that you want to add to a policy.\n\nFilter Records on an Object\nSpecify records to process with your Data Management Policy by selecting an object and setting filter conditions. You can process records that meet any condition, all conditions, or a custom arrangement of conditions.\n Mask or Delete Records on an Object\nDefine how an object’s records are masked or deleted from your org, and determine how related files and attachments are handled.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
