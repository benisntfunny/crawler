Order Management includes some flow core actions that you can use to implement configurable routing rules. These actions work together by first identifying locations that can fulfill an order and then determining which locations are closest to the recipient. You can also access this functionality using the Connect API.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nMinimize Splits Routing Rule\n\nThe Find Routes with Fewest Splits action evaluates an order’s product quantities against available inventory to determine the smallest set of locations that can combine to fulfill the order. The action executes up to 1,000,000 times, or until finding 10,000 location combinations that meet the allocation criteria.\n\nTo use this action, provide this information.\n\nList of ordered product quantities\nList of available product quantities at individual locations\nOptionally, the maximum number of splits\n\nThe action compares the ordered quantities to the available quantities to determine potential fulfillment options. It starts by looking for single locations with sufficient inventory to fulfill the entire list of ordered products. If it finds any, it returns them in a list. If it doesn't find any, it looks for pairs of locations whose combined inventory can fulfill the order. If it finds any pairs, it returns a list of them. If it doesn't find any, it looks for sets of three locations, and so on.\n\nIf you specify the maximum number of splits, the maximum number of locations in a single combination is one more than the split number. For example, if you specify a maximum of two splits, the action looks for single locations, pairs of locations, and trios of locations that can fulfill the order.\n\nClosest Proximity Routing Rule\n\nThe Order Routing Rank by Average Distance action evaluates sets of locations to determine which set has the shortest average delivery distance based on the recipient’s postal code. When calculating distances, this rule uses a location’s Visitor Address field as the address.\n\nTo use this action, provide this information.\n\nRecipient's country code and postal code\nList of fulfillment location sets\nOptionally, a distance unit and sort order for the results\n\nFor each set of locations, the action calculates the straight-line distance from each location to the recipient's postal code, then calculates their average. It then returns the location sets, sorted by their average distance to the recipient.\n\nSEE ALSO\nOrder Fulfillment\nDistributed Order Management\nFlow Core Action for Order Management: Find Routes with Fewest Splits\nFlow Core Action for Order Management: Use OCI to Find Routes with Fewest Splits\nOmnichannel Inventory\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
