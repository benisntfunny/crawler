Developers can create and deliver any kind of business application entirely on demand and without software. The platform also includes easy to use point-and-click customization tools to help you create solutions for your unique business requirements, without any programming experience.\nAppExchange\tAppExchange is a marketplace featuring hundreds of cloud applications created by Salesforce customers, developers, and partners. Many of the applications are free and all of them are pre-integrated with Salesforce, enabling you to easily and efficiently add functionality.\nSalesforce.com Community\tSalesforce provides training, support, consulting, events, best practices, and discussion boards to help you be successful.

Your organization includes all your data and applications.\nRecord\tA collection of fields that store information about a specific item of a specific type. A record is an object, such as a contact, an account, or an opportunity.

Example: Winter ’15.\n\nFor every Salesforce release, the Salesforce release notes include new features and products that are generally available or in beta release. They also describe all changes to existing features and products. You can find the release notes when you search for “Release Notes” in the Salesforce Help.\n\n\nSalesforce\tThe name of the Salesforce cloud computing CRM service and the company name.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
