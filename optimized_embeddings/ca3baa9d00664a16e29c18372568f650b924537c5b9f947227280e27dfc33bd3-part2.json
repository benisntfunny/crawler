Depending on what the button or link does, the tool suggests a declarative or programmatic alternative that’s compatible with Lightning Experience.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nIn all conversions, your original JavaScript button or link remains untouched.\n\nCONVERSION TYPE\tDESCRIPTION\tCONVERSION AND DEPLOYMENT BEHAVIOR\nCustom Button or Link\tYou can convert the JavaScript button or link to a regular custom button or link.\t\n\nUpon conversion, a button or link matching the functionality and label of the JavaScript button or link is added to your org on the same object as the original. For example, suppose that this org has a JavaScript detail page link called “Visit Website.” After conversion, a custom URL link with the same name appears in the Buttons, Links, and Actions list for the object. The prefix “LCC” is added to the converted button or link’s API Name.\n\nWhen deployed, custom buttons are added as actions to the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section of the affected page layout. Deployed links are added to the Custom Links area of the page layout’s detail section.\n\n\nQuick Action\tYou can convert the JavaScript button to a quick action.\t\n\nUpon conversion, a quick action matching the functionality and label of the JavaScript button is added to your org on the same object as the original. For example, suppose that this org has a JavaScript button called “Create Opportunity.” After conversion, a quick action with the same name appears in the Buttons, Links, and Actions list for the object. The prefix “LCC” is added to the converted button or link’s API Name.\n\nWhen deployed, the quick action is added to the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section of the affected page layout.\n\n\nLightning Component (Full)\tYou can convert the JavaScript button or alert to a Lightning component quick action and retain its full functionality.\t\n\nUpon conversion, a Lightning component bundle with component code and a controller file is added to your org. You can find it in Setup under Custom Code | Lightning Components.\n\nIn addition, a Lightning component action that triggers the new component is created. The Lightning component action has the same name as the original JavaScript button or link.\n\nWhen deployed, the Lightning component action is added to the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section of the affected page layout.\n\n\nLightning Component (Partial)\tYou can partially convert the JavaScript button or alert to a Lightning component.\t\n\nUpon conversion, a Lightning component bundle with component code and a controller file is added to your org.\n\nA Lightning component action that triggers the new component is also created. The Lightning component action has the same name as the original JavaScript button or link.\n\nComplete the component before deploying it. If you don’t have access to a developer to help you with the code, post your issue on the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter Trailblazer Community. Folks there would be glad to help.\n\nAfter the code has been finished to match the functionality of the JavaScript button or link, manually add its Lightning component quick action to the page layout.\n\n\nManual (More Details)\tThe Lightning Experience Configuration Converter can’t convert the item.\tClick Manual (More Details) to get more information and suggested replacements. Sometimes, the reason is because the type isn’t supported for conversion, such as a list view or related list button. In other cases, the JavaScript button or alert is too complex to convert declaratively.\n\nYou can view the converted items in the Buttons, Links, and Actions list in the Object Manager in Setup.\n\nSEE ALSO\nLightning Component Actions\nScan Your Org for Updates with the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
