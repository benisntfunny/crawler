Social Customer Service automatically creates cases for social media mentions, posts, or direct messages from your company’s Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram pages. Set up Email-to-Case, Twitter, and Facebook with guided setup flows.\n\nWhy Do We Use It?\n\nYour customers are reaching out to you across multiple channels, like email, Facebook, and Twitter. Instead of sending someone from your team to camp out on each channel to wait for messages, you can turn your customers’ interactions into cases in Salesforce. Then you can prioritize and assign them all together.\n\nNOTE Salesforce Essentials comes with the Social Customer Service Starter Pack, which means that you can select any 2 engagement channels out of the box.\n\nWhen you’re working on cases from your support email address, you can insert email templates, add attachments, and send your response right from the case. No more hopping between your email and your case list.\n\nWith social cases, the following interactions become cases for your team:\n\nFacebook: Posts to your company’s Facebook page. If you want to use Facebook Messenger in Salesforce, see Chat and Messaging for Essentials.\nTwitter: At-mentions and direct messages to your company’s Twitter account\nYouTube: Comments on videos in your company’s channel\nInstagram: Comments and replies on your company's posts\n\nYou can like, unlike, view source, and delete social media posts from the case feed.\n\nWant to see it in action? Our 1-mnute feature tour will show you how it all works. Watch the tour:  Create Cases from Emails and Social Media Posts (1 minute)\n\nNOTE Emails larger than 32 KB are truncated when they come in as cases, so you’ll have to check your inbox to see those messages in full. And if you use Einstein Activity Capture to sync your emails and calendar, make sure to use a different email address for Email-to-Case. What's Einstein Activity Capture?\nWhy Is It Important?\n\nSave time and let your email and social media interactions come to your team where they already are: in Salesforce. Gathering your customers’ questions in one place lets you and your team manage your open tasks more efficiently and make sure that every customer is heard.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSet Up Email-to-Case with a Guided Setup Flow\nSet Up Facebook or Twitter with Guided Setup Flows\nSet Up Social Customer Service\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
