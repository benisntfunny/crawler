If you’re using a different product to send updates, consult the documentation and support for that product.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited editions.\n\nKeep these things in mind when writing vaccine eligibility updates for recipients.\n\nAvoid making guaranteed eligibility claims. We recommend citing national or local public health authority guidance as the source of truth when sharing eligibility information.\nDon’t include recipients’ personal information in the body of your emails and text messages. For example, instead of saying, “You’re 62, so you’re eligible to receive a vaccine,” try, “According to your local public health guidelines, all residents over 55 years old are eligible to receive a vaccine.”\nWhen conducting recipient outreach, provide multiple modes of contact in your call to action. For example, include both a link to the website as well as the phone number, so that recipients with feature phones (non-smartphones) or without regular access to the internet can access necessary information.\nWhen sending appointment-confirmation messages, specify the types of accepted identification that a registrant can bring.\nVerify recipients’ email addresses and phone numbers before sending targeted messages. We recommend sending all recipients a randomly generated, one-time-use code or using Multi-Factor Authentication.\nFollow our tips for Integrating Ethics into Vaccine Management.\n\nAnd keep these things in mind when sending vaccine eligibility updates to recipient groups.\n\nUse relevant field values to determine target recipients. Don’t use fields with personal information such as name, email, or phone number. This helps to keep recipients’ information private, and prevents accidental sharing of information with others who have the same name or share a phone number.\nMake vaccine eligibility and prioritization decisions in accordance with local public health guidance, and follow a rules-based approach. Don’t use AI to make decisions, or to predict or infer personal characteristics that might impact a person’s eligibility or priority for a vaccine.\nTo ensure that your emails get to recipients, follow email deliverability best practices.\nSet up Marketing Cloud Engagement to Send Emails to Vaccine Eligibility Recipients\nPrepare and send emails to recipients using Content Builder and Journey Builder in Marketing Cloud Engagement.\nSet up Marketing Cloud Engagement to Send Text Messages to Vaccine Eligibility Recipients\nPrepare and send text messages to Vaccine Eligibility recipients using Mobile Studio in Marketing Cloud Engagement.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
