To further organize your content, create another workspace. All your workspaces appear as a list on the Content tab.\n\nTo create a marketing workspace, click Add workspace from the All CMS Workspaces list, and then select Marketing for the purpose. To start using the workspace, a content admin must add contributors and assign contributor roles.\n\nYou can share and unshare content created in one workspace (source) across multiple target marketing workspaces when you have a content admin or content manager role in both the source and target workspaces.\n\nTo establish a shared relationship for workspaces, from the workspace settings menu, click , and then select Workspace Sharing. Move the target workspaces from the Unshared column to the Shared column, and save your changes.\n\nWhen you share workspaces, all items in the source workspace, including drafts, are accessible to the shared target workspaces.\n\nTo see shared content, visit the target workspace and open the “Shared with Workspaces” folder.\n\nTo modify and delete shared content, you must be a content admin, content manager, or content author in the source workspace.\n\nTo publish and unpublish shared content, you must be a content admin or content manager in the source workspace.\n\nAll marketing workspaces are connected to two default CMS channels. The Marketing Messages channel sends emails and SMS messages, and the Marketing Landing Pages site channel hosts your landing pages. When you share a source workspace, its published content becomes available to all channels in the target workspace- which includes default channels and any other site channels added to the workspace. Similarly, when you unshare a source workspace with a target workspace, its content items become unavailable in the target workspace and unpublish from the target workspace. The content is then unavailable to channels in the target workspace, and to other content items in the target workspace that reference it.\n\nEXAMPLE  When you share Space A to Space B, you can use an image in Space A in a landing page in Space B. If space B is shared to Space C, publishing the landing page to Space C's channels will not publish the image. Instead, you need to share Space A to Space C, and then publish the image.\n\nTo see a list of workspaces that use a particular content item, open the Usage Info tab of the content detail page.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce CMS\nCMS Workspaces\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
