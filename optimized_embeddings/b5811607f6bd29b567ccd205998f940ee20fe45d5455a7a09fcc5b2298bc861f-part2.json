Collect new responses for certain questions on assessment forms, and prefill other questions with data retrieved from previous assessment responses. To access data from previously submitted responses, activate the prefill assessment question decision table and the prefill with decision table integration procedure. Then set up OmniScripts to determine whether to prefill questions.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Professional, and Unlimited Editions with Financial Services Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Health Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Education Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Nonprofit Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Public Sector Solutions\n\nKeep in mind that:\n\nOn Experience Cloud sites, assessments show prefilled questions only for authenticated users, not for guest users.\nTo use prefilled questions, community users must have Read access to the Account, Case, Contact, Omni Process, and Response Context fields on the Assessment object. If you don’t want community users to have Read access to these fields, remove the corresponding filters from the GetAssessmentIdForContext Omnistudio Data Mapper.\nQuestions are prefilled only on newly opened assessments.\nTo prefill a question, the prefill with decision table integration procedure (DiscoveryFramework_PrefillWithDecisionTable) uses the response from the most recently completed assessment.\n\nTo prefill all the questions for which data is available, rather than specific questions, you use a different integration procedure and no decision table. See Use Data from Previously Submitted Responses.\n\nEnable Prefill Assessment Questions\nTurn on the Prefill Assessment Questions feature so that for specific questions, your users can verify auto-populated data from their previous assessment responses.\nSet Up Prefill Assessment Questions\nDecide which assessment questions to prefill and configure OmniScripts to use data from responses submitted previously.\nAssign Permissions for Decision Tables\nUpdate the relevant profiles or permission sets for users who complete assessments so that they can invoke the decision table that prefills assessment questions.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
