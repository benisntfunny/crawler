Harness the power of Lightning to transform your business and benefit everyone, from execs and business users to admins and developers.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nGet all the features and functionality that you’re entitled to by transitioning your org to the new user interface, Lightning Experience. As an admin, you are your company’s trusted advisor for all things Salesforce and you’ll help decide how to prepare for and roll out Lightning Experience to your users. This guide walks you through the recommended process, including key steps and best practices.\n\nIt’s Time for Lightning Experience\nThe time for Lightning Experience is now! Salesforce Classic isn’t going away yet, but all new Salesforce innovation is in Lightning Experience only. Clearly Lightning Experience is the place to be, so how do you get there? Fear not, there are resources and tools at your fingertips to help you take control and drive a smooth transition.\nDiscover Phase: Start Your Lightning Experience Transition\nKick off your Lightning Experience transition with a discovery period. Learn about the benefits and ROI that your company can get from moving to Lightning Experience and evaluate your production org's readiness for the new interface. Then plan your rollout and change management strategies and align with stakeholders on your transition goals.\nRoll Out Phase: Get Ready to Launch Lightning Experience\nWith your rollout plan in place and your stakeholders on board, you’re ready to start preparing your org—and your users—for Lightning Experience. This is the time to kick off your change management strategy. And time to get busy on release development activities, including implementing Lightning Experience features and addressing the priority issues noted in your Readiness Report. The last piece is going live by giving users access to the new interface!\nOptimize Phase: Make Lightning Experience Stick\nThe transition project doesn't end when you give users access to Lightning Experience. Busy people aren't always eager for change, so keep an eye on adoption rates and encourage users to stay in the new interface. This is also the time to iterate on your rollout plan by moving over more users, adding new features and use cases, and looking for ways to improve your implementation. And when the day comes to turn off access to Salesforce Classic, you can call your transition a success!\nFind Your Way Around Lightning Experience\nFeeling a little discombobulated by all the Lightning Experience newness? Perfectly understandable. Diving into a redesigned app can be disorienting—especially when you’re able to work in the original interface with your eyes closed. To hone your Lightning Experience chops, let’s look at where some of the most common Salesforce features landed in the new interface.\nLightning Experience Considerations\nLightning Experience re-envisions Salesforce and as a result, there are some classic features that have been implemented differently or don’t have a place in the new interface. And there are some classic features that are on the roadmap for an upcoming release. Review these topics to see if any functionality that’s critical to your business has changed significantly in Lightning Experience, or is limited or unavailable in this release. This information can help you train users about what to expect when you roll out Lightning Experience.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
