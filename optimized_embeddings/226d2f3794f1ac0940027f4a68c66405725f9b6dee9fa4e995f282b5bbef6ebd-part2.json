Transition your org to Files to integrate file access into your business flow.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, you used documents to store assets, like logos, and you could associate an attachment only to a record. Files in Lightning Experience gives users more ways to share and access information. In Lightning Experience, users can upload their files to Files Home for storage and sharing. Users can share a file by attaching it to a Chatter post, profile, record, or group. When you add the Files related list to a page layout, users can access Files features on pages throughout the app.\n\nSalesforce Classic files are available in Lightning Experience in Files Home and on associated records under the Files related list. Salesforce CRM content libraries are automatically converted to Files and accessible from Files Home via the Libraries filter.\n\nUse Salesforce tools to convert your org’s attachments and documents. Find your converted files in Files Home or Files related lists.\n\nNext Steps: Convert Attachments and Documents\nTo optimize access to your files throughout the app, Add the Files Related List to Page Layouts.\nReview the Magic Mover for Notes and Attachments documentation under Customization Guides. Before using the Magic Mover, enable enhanced Notes so that users maintain information in their notes.\nFollow the steps in Moving Documents to Salesforce Files.\nFind out more about working with Files in Lightning Experience.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
