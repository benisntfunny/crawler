These packages are considered Non-SFDC Applications under your organization’s Main Services Agreement, and that Main Services Agreement doesn’t apply to your use of these packages.\nConsiderations for Safety Cloud Packages in General\n\nThese considerations apply to Safety Cloud Packages in general.\n\nSafety Cloud packages intend to provide tools that help accelerate your deployment of vaccine registration, vaccine post processing, and COVID-19 health verification solutions.\n\nMake configuration decisions based on your particular use case.\n\nTo ensure the security of recipients’ information, we recommend using Multi-Factor Authentication and enabling Platform Encryption.\nMake sure that you follow secure coding guidelines. For more information, see the Salesforce Security Guide.\nTo manage public access to your vaccine form, follow Experience Cloud security practices. See Secure Your Experience Cloud Sites and Guest User Record Access Developer Best Practices.\nBe mindful of the values that you store about your recipients. We recommend that you avoid collecting information that you don’t need and any sensitive information that could be used for discrimination or other unlawful purposes. For more information, see our Acceptable Use and External-Facing Services Policy.\nAdhere to the accepted data-retention policies and related privacy laws for your organization, wherever they apply.\nTo help ensure equity in vaccine distribution and administration, review the Principles for the Ethical Use of COVID-19 Vaccine Technology Solutions and follow our tips for Integrating Ethics into Vaccine Management.\nConsiderations for the Vaccine Eligibility Package\n\nThese considerations apply to Vaccine Eligibility Package specifically.\n\nPrerequisites for Vaccine Cloud Eligibility Packages\nIf you plan to use Marketing Cloud Engagement to send updates to recipients, set it up first. For details, see Marketing Cloud Engagement Setup.\nMake sure that you have the correct licenses. For the eligibility packages, you need Health Cloud and Health Cloud Platform permission set licenses enabled in your org.\nIn Setup, turn on Data Protection and Privacy, and select Make data protection details available in records.\nTo improve security and performance with the Vaccine Eligibility packages, deactivate the Standard Lead Duplicate Rule in Setup | Data Management | Duplicate Management | Duplicate Rules. If you don’t, legitimate recipients sometimes are unable to sign up for or receive updates.\nWhat the Eligibility Package Changes in Your Org\nWhen you download the Vaccine Eligibility packages, several things happen:\nWe turn on the Site.com Akamai Page Cache permission.\nTwo consent records, DataUseLegalBasis and DataUsePurpose, are created for your org with the name Vaccine Eligibility Updates.\nWe add a Visualforce page for each part of the sign-up flow: Vaccination Sign-Up Form, Vaccination Sign-Up Success Page, Vaccination Sign-Up Start Page, and Vaccination Sign-Up Error Page.\nWhen a recipient signs up using the form, we create a lead record with their information. When you follow the setup steps in this guide, related individual and consent records are created for each lead with a scheduled Apex job.\nThe Vaccine Eligibility Form package has a strategy to help prevent losing sign-ups during the flow:\nYou can capture and report skipped leads. When handling Registration events, EventLeadRegistrationTrigger receives events in a batch and processes each event to create a lead record. If we can’t create a lead due to an invalid or incomplete set of properties, we skip it and process the next one in the batch.\nIf an exception occurs during the operation, we maintain the event processing order. After EventLeadRegistrationTrigger processes a batch, the list of leads is queued into the AsyncLeadInsert for lead insertion into the database. When there’s an error, the batch of events is resent and processed again after a delay, during which no other event is delivered.\nWe create a list of leads that failed to insert into the database, which you can capture and report. The AsyncLeadInsert Apex job adds leads to one of two lists: insertedLeads or failedLeads.\nYou can capture and report when an exception occurs during the AsyncLeadInsert Apex job.\nIf there’s an unexpected failure during the AsyncLeadInsert Apex job, we retry the same operation up to five times.\nEligibility Product Limits\n\nSalesforce sets an hourly peak limit of 1,200,000 for Asynchronous Registration submissions.\n\nIf you anticipate exceeding this limit, contact Salesforce.\n\nTo contact Salesforce, log a case, and provide this information.\nThe production or sandbox Organization ID. To find your org’s ID, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and then click Company Information.\nYour requested limit.\nA business reason for the limit increase.\nLanguage Support for Eligibility Packages\nSupported languages for the Vaccine Eligibility packages are English, Spanish (Mexico), French (Canada), and Japanese.\n\nTo provide the Vaccine Cloud solutions in another language, use Translation Workbench. We don’t support right-to-left languages.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
