All developers can work together to deliver value to customers in a repeatable and scalable way, whether you use declarative builders, write code in Salesforce Extensions for VS Code, leverage the power and flexibility of Salesforce CLI, or all three.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Professional, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\nAvailable in: Government Cloud Plus as interoperable. Turning on DevOps Center in Government Cloud Plus orgs can send data outside the authorization boundary. Contact your Salesforce account executive for more details.\nNot available in: EU Operating Zone. EU Operating zone is a special paid offering that provides an enhanced level of data residency commitment. DevOps Center is supported in orgs in the EU that aren’t part of EU OZ, per standard product terms and conditions.\n\nDevOps Center lets you choose whether to manage your releases from its point-and-click interface, or directly from the source control system, or a combination of both. Under the hood, we manage the source control branches so developers and builders can focus on development tasks.\n\nBecause all changes are captured in a source control system, you have a single source of truth for configuration and code, which improves collaboration across all functions: admins, developers, release managers, QA, and other business stakeholders.\n\nAre you looking for an alternative to change sets based on modern development best practices? We thought so.\n\nBefore You Begin: Install and Configure DevOps Center\nInstall DevOps Center.\nFamiliarize yourself with the requirements for running and using DevOps Center.\nUnderstand what types of development environments we support.\nConfigure DevOps Center to provide access to team members, create projects, create and assign work items, build your release pipeline, and so on.\n\nSee Salesforce Help: Install and Configure DevOps Center for details.\n\nOne Collaboration Tool to Support a Variety of Roles\n\nWorking on Salesforce customizations requires a variety of tasks by teams large and small. The degree of role specialization varies, and team members frequently have more than one role over the course of a release. The team roles we recommend include:\n\nTeam Manager or Project Manager\nSalesforce admin\nLow-code developer (Builder)\nPro-code developer\nRelease Manager\nBusiness owner\nEnvironments manager\nQuality Assurance Specialist\n\nTo ensure that team members have access to the features they require to do their work, we provide several DevOps Center permission sets. Your Salesforce admin (or team manager) assigns you the appropriate permissions to access DevOps Center functionality.\n\nIf you perform multiple roles and don’t have access to functionality required to do your job, talk to your team manager.\n\nProvide General Feedback\n\nIf you want to provide general feedback, request product enhancements, start discussions with other DevOps Center users or the product team, and share best practices, use the DevOps Center Trailblazer group.\n\nGet Started with DevOps Center\nAfter your team manager or Salesforce admin has installed and configured DevOps Center, you’ll be notified that the DevOps Center org is ready for you to log in. As part of the setup process, they created one or more projects, source control project repositories, and work items associated with each project. They also added each team member’s source-tracked development environment.\nWork Item Management\nA team uses work items to track the progress of changes created to achieve a specific objective or task. These tasks can include enabling a user story, creating a feature, or addressing a bug. Managing releases through work items makes it easier to track the progress of the overall release and identify areas of concern.\nAre You Sharing a Development Environment?\nChanges are associated in DevOps Center with the development environment within a project. Therefore, we recommend that all developers have their own development environment. A single development environment can be connected to multiple work items.\nWhat Happens When a Sandbox Is Refreshed\nRefreshing a sandbox creates a new copy of the sandbox based on the production or sandbox org you copy it from.\nDetermine Which Changes to Include for the Work Item\nThe work item Changes tab is where you can see the changes you made in the development environment. As you make changes in the development environment, the source-tracking feature keeps a record of the component files that have been added, deleted, or changed.\nCommit Changes to the Source Control Repository\nAfter you decide which changes to include for the work item, commit the changes to the project source control repository. When you commit changes, you store them in the project repository branch in GitHub that was created when the work item moved to the In Progress stage.\nView Work Item Events in Activity History\nYou can view the Activity History for each work item, which provides a comprehensive history of all key events, including promotions, commits, work item status changes, warnings, and errors (failures). This historical view enables you to maintain and view a record of events and associated details for auditing, troubleshooting, and general visibility purposes.\nSynchronize Your Development Environment\nIf you’re working on a team with multiple developers, it’s likely that your dev environment is going to become out of sync with the source control repository. DevOps Center tracks the differences between each development environment and the first pipeline stage’s branch.\nReview Changes with Team Members\nWhen changes for an In Progress work item are committed and ready to share with reviewers, creating a Review opens a change request, called a pull request in GitHub.\nIndicate That Work Items Are Ready to Promote\nAfter the work item is reviewed, a team member approves the work item to be ready to promote. Work items aren’t available for promotion through the pipeline until they are in the Ready to Promote status.\nExternal Change Requests and Merges\nYou can create a change request and merge your changes directly in the source control system, which is the first half of the promotion process. You can complete the promotion by deploying all externally merged changes to the pipeline stage’s associated environment within DevOps Center or by using Salesforce CLI.\nPromote Work Items Through Your Pipeline\nYou promote work items through a pipeline, which defines the sequence of stages that work items progress as they go through the release lifecycle from development to production (or some other final stage). You can have any number of pipeline stages. Your team manager built the pipeline when configuring DevOps Center.\nView Pipeline Events in Activity History\nDevOps Center provides a comprehensive history of all key pipeline events, including promotions, synchronizations, and errors (failures). You can use these events and their associated details for auditing, troubleshooting, and general visibility purposes.\nConflict Detection and Resolution\nConflicts can occur when you’re working with multiple development environments and moving changes between multiple pipeline stages. Conflicts can take different forms, and DevOps Center provides functionality to help you identify potential conflicts early and resolve them.\nTroubleshoot DevOps Center Errors\nHere are some tips if you encounter issues while using DevOps Center. If needed, get help from your team manager or Salesforce admin to resolve these issues.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Help: Install and Configure DevOps Center\nDevOps Center Developer Guide\nSalesforce Help: Assign the DevOps Center Permission Sets\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
