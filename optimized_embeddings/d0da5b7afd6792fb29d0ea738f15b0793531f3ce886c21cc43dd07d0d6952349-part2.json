We guide you through getting an overview of the import process, fixing up what’s already in Salesforce, and preparing your spreadsheet for a smooth import.\n\nSalesforce comes to life when you import your data. Fix up what’s in Salesforce and tidy your spreadsheets to facilitate this process.\n\nSee How It Works\nACTION\tDETAILS\nWatch setup videos\tOur data import series has a lot of useful information to help you get started. For tips and tricks for how to create a clean import file, start with Clean Your Import File and Best Practices for Importing Data.\nTake a hands-on workshop\tLearn how to clean and import your data into Salesforce with our live and on-demand hands-on workshop. Follow the data import process from the beginning for a smooth data import journey.\nFix What’s Already in Salesforce\nACTION\tDETAILS\nFix incomplete information in Salesforce\tIf you already have some information in Salesforce, make sure that it’s all filled in. Complete and accurate records help us prevent duplicates and errors when you import more information. For every Salesforce record, include first and last names, email addresses, phone numbers, company names, job titles, and whatever else you use to distinguish your contacts, deals, and accounts.\nCheck for required fields\t\n\nRequired fields are in place to make sure that your data is organized correctly. To avoid errors, verify that they’re included in your spreadsheet.\n\nThe following fields are required for accounts, contacts, and leads:\n\nRequired fields for Accounts: name\nRequired fields for Contacts: last name\nRequired fields for Leads: last name, company name\n\nThe required field names are listed in red during the import process, but you can look at what’s required before you start. For example, create an opportunity and see which fields are marked as required. You can also click Save before entering any information to highlight the required fields.\n\n\nCustomize fields\tCreate the custom fields you need in Salesforce before importing data. When you include the names of your custom fields in your spreadsheet, your information has somewhere to go in Salesforce. To create custom fields, go to Setup | Object Manager.\nGet Your Spreadsheet in Tip-Top Shape\n\nWhen you clean up your spreadsheet, your import goes much more smoothly because every bit of information has its place in Salesforce.\n\nACTION\tDETAILS\nKeep accounts and contacts in the same place\tSave time and import contacts and accounts together by including both in your .csv file. If you prefer, you can import them separately using dataloader.io instead of the Data Import Wizard in Salesforce.\nDelete any duplicates\tMake sure that your file doesn’t contain duplicate entries. You can have multiple contacts for one account, but avoid entering the same contact twice or importing the same person as both a contact and a lead.\nFormat properly\tClearly separate fields in your spreadsheet. For example, if you include addresses, make sure that there are separate columns for street, city, state, and zip.\nInclude email addresses with names\tYou have two options to match your data: either by name or by email. Emails are more unique than names, so it’s best practice to keep your contacts and accounts matched by email.\nEdit the record owners\tWhen you import new data, include an Owner Full Name column to keep items assigned properly. If you don’t include owners, you’re made the owner of everything that’s created during the import. When you update existing data, use record owner IDs to link your records to an owner in Salesforce.\nTriple-check the spelling\tYou can edit the spelling after your data is imported, but it’s difficult to find what you’re looking for if a name or company is misspelled. You can also end up with duplicates if you have two different spellings of the same name.\n\nAfter you clean up your data in Salesforce and in your spreadsheet, you’re ready to start your import. Export your spreadsheet as a .csv file, then start the data import process in Salesforce.\n\nSEE ALSO\nOn-Demand Workshop: Importing Your Contacts in Essentials\nCreate Custom Fields\nDelete Multiple Records and Reports\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
