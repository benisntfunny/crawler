Depending on the nature of the updates and configuration of your org, these sharing calculations can take a while to complete.\nConfiguration changes that cause sharing rule recalculation include:\nChanging an organization's default sharing model\nCreating, editing, or deleting sharing rules\nCreating or transferring any records\nUpdating public group members\nCreating or activating a user\nChanging users’ roles or updating the role hierarchy\nAdding or removing users from territories\nReparenting territories\nMaking changes to roles, territories, or public groups involved in sharing rules\nConfiguration changes that cause group membership recalculation include:\nChanging or reparenting roles\nAdding or removing users from territories\nUpdating public group members\nUpdating portal account ownership if the new owner has a different role\nConfiguration changes that don’t cause group membership or sharing rule recalculation include:\nTerritory realignment\nUpdates to sharing sets\nOptimization\nContact Salesforce Customer Support to enable the defer sharing calculations feature. You can defer sharing calculations if you must make large-scale or high-impact changes that trigger sharing recalculation, and want to suspend some automatic sharing calculations to a later time to prevent timeouts or performance issues. For more information, see Defer Sharing Calculations.\nCheck to see if any user owns more than 10,000 records of an object, which can cause performance issues. We recommend that you distribute records among a larger group of records before making sharing updates. For more information, see Ownership Data Skew in the Designing Record Access for Enterprise Scale guide.\nIf not yet enabled in your org, enable faster account sharing recalculation. For more information, see the Faster Account Sharing Recalculation knowledge article.\nDeferring Sharing Calculations\nDeferring sharing calculations is intended for operations like large-scale maintenance updates or org realignments that require group membership or sharing rule recalculation.\nEven if you’re making only a few configuration changes, consider deferring sharing calculations if the number of affected records or users is very large. For example, you make changes to only a few sharing rules, but for objects that have a significant volume of data. Or, you must edit a few owner-based sharing rules, but this change impacts a large number of users who own the records being shared.\nChanges that aren’t directly related to updating your sharing settings can also impact sharing recalculation and benefit from deferring sharing calculations. For example, you upload a large volume of data for one or more objects that have many existing sharing rules.\nIf you defer sharing rule calculations, only updates that involve sharing rules, whether directly or indirectly, are deferred, while other sharing-related changes are still processed immediately. To give a few examples, if you create sharing rules or update roles that are referenced in sharing rules, the resulting recalculations are paused. However, if you create manual shares, update teams or queues, or update roles that aren’t referenced in any sharing rules, those changes are still evaluated immediately.\nIf you defer group membership calculations, membership changes involving individual users are still reflected immediately. However, membership changes related to nested groups or due to role hierarchy changes aren’t reflected until after group membership calculations are resumed and you complete a full recalculation. Any change in record access resulting from membership changes also isn’t processed until calculation is resumed and you complete a full recalculation.\nIf you find that organizational changes and sharing rule updates typically complete quickly enough to be scheduled into the workday or periods of lower activity, you’re unlikely to benefit substantially from deferring sharing calculations.\nIf you defer sharing calculations, you must always complete a full sharing rule recalculation after you resume group membership or sharing rule calculations. This recalculation ensures that all of your changes are reflected in your sharing rules. If you don’t do a full sharing rule recalculation, there can be issues with record access behavior.\nWe recommend that you resume sharing calculations immediately after making your changes. Then, start the full sharing rule recalculation as soon as possible during a period of low activity. By resuming sharing immediately, new updates are processed immediately, meaning there are fewer changes that must be recalculated. Completing the full sharing recalculation in a timely manner then ensures that record access behaves as expected without significant lag time.\nTesting\nTest making your updates, including resuming sharing recalculation if applicable, in a full copy sandbox before you make these changes in production. This test allows you to both identify any potential issues that can take time and get an estimate of how long the whole process will take in production.\nThe full copy sandbox should mimic your current product environment as closely as possible. We recommend using a sandbox refreshed within the last 30 days. In addition, all major changes must be reflected in the sandbox.\nTiming\nPlan for a maintenance window that’s sufficiently long to complete your changes and for the sharing recalculation to complete.\nSchedule the maintenance window for a period of low activity in your org, such as a weekend.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
