To preview as an authenticated user, you must be added as a contributor to the Marketing Landing Pages site. When you preview your landing page, also review any attached forms.\n\nIf your landing page references an image that has an external URL, it doesn’t appear correctly if its domain isn’t included in your trusted URL list.

A redirect URL must begin with https:// and contain fewer than 2,000 characters.\n\nTo edit a URL redirect, deactivate the URL alias.\nOpen the landing page content detail page and then click URL.\nClick .\nEnter a valid URL redirect.\nSave your work.\nSEE ALSO\nCreate a Landing Page in Marketing Cloud Growth\nSEO Page Properties for Landing Pages in Marketing Cloud Growth\nAdd Site Contributors to Marketing Cloud Growth\nManage Trusted URLs\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
