Create a CMS channel with and then associate that channel with a CMS workspace. Channels can correspond to publishing endpoints such as a website or email message. Or create custom endpoint integration with third-party sites by using Salesforce headless APIs. After you publish your content from the CMS workspace, it becomes available in CMS channels.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nIn the Digital Experiences app (previously named Salesforce CMS), you create channels to publish content to, then add those channels to CMS workspaces. Salesforce supports unlimited Experience Cloud site channels and up to 300 other channels. To view all CMS Channels on the CMS Channels tab, click the down arrow on the tab menu  (1), then click CMS Channels (2). \n\nAll CMS channels have a connection type. The connection type determines which audience can access the CMS content delivered in the channel. When you create a CMS channel in the Digital Experiences app (previously named Salesforce CMS) you can choose from public, restricted, or the B2C Commerce Page Designer. When you create a CMS channel outside of the app, the connection types can be Experience Cloud sites, Account Engagement emails (which are public connections), or external channels.\n\nPublic Connection\n\nTo publish content intended for a public audience or to connect content to custom applications, create a public connection type. Public connections are ideal for marketing emails, websites, and custom apps. Only public channels can have an assigned domain.\n\nPublic channel content can be served with high-performance delivery when you use a content delivery network (CDN), which you can configure in Salesforce Setup. You can assign a CDN to a public channel from within the Digital Experiences app (previously named Salesforce CMS). An easy way to get started is to use Salesforce’s CDN for Digital Experiences and a default domain hosted by our CDN partner, Akamai (requires a custom domain). Or use a CDN of your choice to deliver Salesforce CMS content to your Experience Cloud site. Then, edit the channel to configure the domain.\n\nRestricted Connection\n\nTo publish content intended for specific users such as an employee intranet, partner portal, Lightning app, or connected Salesforce app, create a restricted channel. Define a permission set and apply it to the restricted channel for the users that you want to access the content through APIs. You can’t serve restricted channel content from a CDN.\n\nB2C Commerce Page Designer Connection\n\nTo develop rich, content-driven shopping experiences for your customers by using your Salesforce CMS content and the B2C commerce page designer, create a Commerce Cloud channel.\n\nContact Salesforce Customer Support or your success manager to establish a trust relationship between Salesforce CMS and your B2C Commerce instance. To use your CMS content in the B2C Commerce Page Designer, your Business Manager admin must configure the connected Commerce Cloud instance in the Business Manager.\n\nExperience Cloud Site Channels\n\nYou can create a site connection by adding the site channel to your CMS workspace. First create an Experience Cloud site, then add the Experience Cloud site channel to a CMS workspace. When you publish content from a CMS workspace to an Aura or LWR Experience Cloud site channel, the content is automatically available to use in Experience Builder. Aura and LWR sites use the Digital Experiences app (previously named Salesforce CMS) to curate and organize content, and publish content from a CMS workspace. When you create an Experience Builder site, ensure that it’s based on the most up-to-date Lightning template.\n\nIMPORTANT You can use Salesforce CMS content in sites created with all Experience Builder templates. However, use an enhanced CMS workspace to publish content to enhanced LWR sites with the Microsite or Build Your Own (LWR) templates. Enhanced CMS workspaces only support enhanced LWR site channels.\n\nUser access to published content is controlled by the settings of the site.\n\nTo share and organize Salesforce CMS content with the B2B Commerce managed package or in other Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce sites, use the API. See the Connect REST API Developer Guide and Apex Reference Guide.\n\nAccount Engagement Email Channels\n\nTo share Salesforce CMS content with your Account Engagement email design materials, create a public connection type and use Salesforce’s CDN for Digital Experiences as the domain for that CMS channel. See the Configure Salesforce CMS for Account Engagement Email help.\n\nExternal Channels\n\nDeliver your Salesforce CMS content across all the places your customers consume it. Use our headless APIs to connect to external third-party sites. See the Connect REST API Developer Guide and the Apex Reference Guide.\n\nCreate a Channel to Share Salesforce CMS Content\nCreate CMS channels in the Digital Experience app, either from the CMS Channels tab or within a CMS workspace. Then add the channel to CMS workspaces. When you publish content in a CMS workspace, it’s shared to all the channels added to that workspace.\nAdd a Channel to a CMS Workspace\nCMS channels deliver content from a CMS workspace to an audience. Content published in a CMS workspace is shared to all the channels added to the workspace. Channels can't be removed from the CMS workspace.\nConfigure the Salesforce CDN for Salesforce CMS\nUse the Salesforce content delivery network (CDN) to serve Salesforce CMS content on your sites, send enhanced emails, and serve custom applications. Set a cache duration for CMS content served in Salesforce CDN channels and configure a domain that links content from your public channel to the CDN.\nPreview Salesforce CMS Content on Your Site\nSee how your CMS content looks on your Aura or LWR site on a desktop or mobile device. You can preview content in any status on any site channel that’s connected to the CMS workspace.\nCollections In Enhanced CMS Workspaces\nA collection is a set of content items in Salesforce CMS. Collections keep content items grouped and ready to use in your channels. You can create collections right from your enhanced CMS workspace.\nSearch Content in Salesforce CMS\nMake finding CMS content easier for your users. Configure search within all your channels, including Experience Cloud sites, Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Heroku, LEX apps, and more.\nSEE ALSO\nServe Your Experience Cloud Site with the Salesforce Content Delivery Network (CDN)\nThe Build Your Own Template (LWR)\nLWR Sites for Experience Cloud: Create an LWR Site\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
