Practitioners include doctors, nurses, physical therapists, and other clinical staff. Facilities include hospitals, clinics, labs, and other organizations.\n\nWhen you set up healthcare provider data, create a record to represent the provider as a person or an organization, and then create a record to represent what the provider does.\n\nFor organizations, create accounts with a Business record type.\n\nFor people, create person accounts or contacts, but we strongly recommend person accounts. A person account combines an account and a contact. Person accounts are a better fit for healthcare providers who are their own independent entity with practicing rights at a number of locations. These individuals have their own unique identification number, such as a National Provider Identifier (NPI), which follows them regardless of where they work. If you map individual providers as contacts, there are limited capabilities for these records.\n\nTo represent providers in terms of what they do, create healthcare provider records. These records store business-level details about the healthcare organization or person, such as the provider type.\n\nA person account record and a healthcare provider record combine to represent the FHIR Practitioner resource in Salesforce. The healthcare provider record is the base, and it references the person account record using the AccountId field.\n\nNOTE Model providers using both the Healthcare Provider object and person accounts to ensure they’re aligned to the FHIR Practitioner resource and they can appear in features such as provider search. If you model providers only as person accounts, you may not be able to use features such as provider search.\n\nTo define the relationship between a practitioner and a facility, create a healthcare practitioner facility record that specifies the facility’s account record and the practitioner’s person account or contact record. Healthcare practitioner facility records represent the set of services that a practitioner provides at a specific location.\n\nCreate additional records to store provider care specialties, certifications, education, and licenses, and for the payer network that a healthcare provider is affiliated with.\n\nCreate Records for Healthcare Practitioners\nCreate a person account record to represent a healthcare practitioner as a person and create a healthcare provider record to represent what the practitioner does.\nCreate Records for Healthcare Organizations\nCreate a business account record to represent a healthcare facility as an organization and create a healthcare provider record to represent what the organization does.\nCreate Healthcare Facilities\nCreate a healthcare facility record to represent the facility's physical, geographic, or functional details. A healthcare organization’s local branches or facilities need healthcare facility records that reference a business account and a healthcare provider record for that specific branch or facility.\nConnect Healthcare Practitioners with Facilities\nDefine the relationship between a practitioner and a facility or organization by creating a healthcare practitioner facility record to represent the set of services that a practitioner provides at that facility or for that organization.\nCreate Healthcare Facility and Payer Networks\nCreate healthcare payer network records for insurance network groups, and then create healthcare facility network records to identify the payer network that a facility or organization is a part of.\nCreate Care Specialty Records\nHealthcare providers can have multiple specialties and subspecialties. Create care specialty and healthcare provider specialty records to represent them. You can also classify specialties and subspecialties using taxonomy records.\nCreate Care Provider Facility Specialty Records\nCreate care provider facility specialty records to represent all the specialties that the practitioner provides at a specific facility or for a specific organization. These records help patients find a provider by the specialties they offer at a facility.\nAdd Healthcare Provider Credentials\nCreate records to store healthcare provider credentials such as accreditations, awards, board certifications, business licenses, and education.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Help: Practitioner\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
