Automate some of this effort with out-of-the-box onboarding and assistance options that show the productivity benefits from working in the new interface.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nTry Lightning Experience Now Prompt\nFor users that aren’t taking advantage of the new interface, this prompt reminds them that they can work smarter and faster in Lightning Experience.\nSwitch to Salesforce Classic Feedback Form\nWhen users switch back to Salesforce Classic, ask them why. Responses are collected in a public Chatter group. Evaluate the feedback to see if there are Lightning Experience features that users aren’t aware of, or if there are problems with the current implementation. You can customize the question, how frequently the form appears, and where the feedback is stored.\nLightning Experience Welcome Mat\nHelp onboard users to Lightning Experience with getting started resources, delivered in a friendly welcome mat. There are two welcome mat options: one that appears when a user logs in to Lightning Experience for the first time and one that displays when a user is automatically switched from Salesforce Classic to Lightning Experience. You can customize the welcome mats to deliver content that’s specific to your business and your users’ roles.\nSuggested for You\nEnable relevant, personalized suggestions based on your company’s specific business needs and processes. Suggested for You provides recommendations to adopt new features, ways to do more with what you have, and products we think your users can benefit from.\nEncourage Users to Stay in Lightning Experience\nDrive adoption of the new interface by automatically switching users from Salesforce Classic to Lightning Experience on a regular schedule. You can use the Scheduled Switcher tool to switch users upon login on a daily or weekly basis.\nMake Lightning Experience the Only Experience for Some Users\nReady for some of your users to go all in on Lightning Experience? Keep them in the new interface by removing the option to switch back to Salesforce Classic.\nSEE ALSO\nCustomize the Help Menu in Lightning Experience\nIn-App Guidance\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
