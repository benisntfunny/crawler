Use temporary verification codes to allow users to regain access immediately. When dealing with a broken connection or a missing verification method, revoke the connection and help the user set up a new method.\n\nAvailable only in: Products built on the Salesforce Platform, including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Analytics Cloud, B2B Commerce Cloud Marketing Cloud, Marketing Cloud—Account Engagement, Experience Cloud, Platform, Industries products (Consumer Goods Cloud, Financial Services Cloud, Government Cloud, Health Cloud, Manufacturing Cloud, Philanthropy Cloud), and Salesforce Essentials\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Developer, and Contact Manager Editions\n\nHere are the recommended recovery steps for the most common MFA-related access issues.\n\nUser's Verification Method Isn't Working or Has Been Replaced\n\nUse these access recovery steps if a user registered a verification method but it isn't working when they try to log in. These steps also apply if a user needs to register a method because they have a new mobile device, security key, or computer with a built-in authentication service.\n\nIssue the user a temporary verification code so they can log in while you resolve their issue. See Generate a Temporary Identity Verification Code.\nDisconnect the user's existing verification method.
