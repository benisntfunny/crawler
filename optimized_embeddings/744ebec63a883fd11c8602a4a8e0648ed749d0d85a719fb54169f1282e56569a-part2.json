See links to these learning items in the Guidance Center from anywhere in the app or in Learning Home. Admins see curated checklists with suggested steps and guidance for setup.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo see guidance sets for admins\tModify All Data OR Customize Application\nNOTE\n\nSome pages in Salesforce Classic include a Help for this Page link. The link still appears on many pages in Lightning Experience. Also, the global header in Lightning Experience includes a question mark icon to open the Help Menu. The menu includes links to learning resources. To view the most applicable and current recommendations from Salesforce and your admin, we encourage you to use Guidance Center.\n\nGet Help Anywhere in the App\n\nTo open the panel, click the icon for Guidance Center in the global header.\n\nContent shown in the Guidance Center can change, depending on these factors.\n\nWhere you are in an app.\nWhether you’re an end user or an admin.\nWhether your company assigned content to you or turned off Salesforce suggestions for content.\n\nThe Guidance Center includes different sections for different types of content. See Explore the Guidance Center.\n\nTo see all assigned and suggested learning items in one place, click Go to Learning Home in the Guidance Center panel.\n\nSee All Assigned Learning Items\n\nThe Learning Home page contains these tabs.\n\nThe Required tab shows learning items that are assigned to you with a due date.\nThe Suggested tab shows learning items that are assigned to you but don’t have a due date.\nThe In Progress tab shows Trailhead or Enablement Sites (myTrailhead) modules that you started and haven’t yet finished. This tab doesn’t show other types of learning items.\nThe Completed tab shows learning items that you completed, including assigned or suggested items that you clicked and Trailhead or Enablement Sites (myTrailhead) modules that you earned badges for.\n\nAdmins have access to the Manage Learning Assignments tab, where they can manage the learning items that they assign.\n\nExplore the Guidance Center as an Admin\n\nAdmins see a slightly different view of the side panel and Learning Home.\n\nThe link to Learning Home in the Guidance Center is Assign Learning Content.\nEven when Salesforce suggestions are turned off for end users, admins still see Salesforce suggestions.\n\nAdmins can access guidance sets, which offer personalized setup and learning resources that align with your experience level and business goals. The Guidance Center shows at most two guidance sets at a time, but admins can click View More to see all guidance sets available to them. The guidance sets admins see depend on the Salesforce implementation. For example, we only show setup resources to new orgs. Admins receive notifications when new guidance sets are added.\n\nIf available, be sure to answer a couple of questions to personalize your guidance. After you submit your answers, review the tailored list of Trailhead modules, videos, prompts, and other resources as you get set up.\n\nAlthough we recommend that you click the links in order, feel free to explore. Prompts, videos, and internal links appear inside the app, while all other resources open in a new tab.\n\nAs you click through resources and complete steps in a guidance set, some steps require an additional click to mark them as complete. Steps tied to an action, such as creating a record, require you to click the sync progress button  to mark that item as complete. Other steps such as internal links and videos are checked off automatically as you click through them.\n\nBecause guidance sets bring more personalized setup guidance, the Setup Assistant no longer appears in Setup. Essentials and Marketing Setup Assistants still appear. Also, the Lightning Experience welcome mat doesn’t appear to admins.\n\nAccess Trailhead or Enablement Site (myTrailhead) Content from the Guidance Center\n\nYou don’t log in to Trailhead or an enablement site (formerly myTrailhead) inside Lightning Experience. If your company doesn’t have an enablement site, make sure that all your Salesforce-related accounts are part of your Trailblazer.me profile. That way, the badges that you earn in-app are included in your profile. See Trailblazer.me and Trailhead.\n\nIf your company has an enablement site, you don’t necessarily have a Trailblazer.me profile, but you can create one. See Create a Trailhead Account, and log in with the username and password that you use to log in to Salesforce. If your company uses Salesforce Identity for Enablement to authenticate users to your enablement site, the Trailhead badges that you earn in-app appear on your Trailblazer.me profile. The enablement site badges that you earn don’t appear on your Trailblazer.me profile. See Considerations for Selecting an Authentication Provider\n\nSEE ALSO\nAssign a Learning Item for Learning Paths\nCustomize Content in the Guidance Center\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
