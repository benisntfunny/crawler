Develop a strategy that works for your company's size, business goals, and the Salesforce products that you use.\n\nNOTE The guidance in this topic doesn’t apply to single sign-on (SSO) logins, API logins, or to setting up an MFA requirement for customers who access your Salesforce Experience Cloud sites or ecommerce sites.\nStrategies for Rolling Out MFA to Users\n\nThere are two ways you can approach the rollout. Turn on MFA for all your users at the same time. Or turn it on for groups of users over several days, weeks, or months.\n\nIf you have only a few Salesforce users, it’s probably most efficient to roll out MFA to everyone on the same day.\nWe recommend taking a phased approach when your user base is large enough that enabling everyone at the same time isn’t practical. Or if preparing all users for a single launch date delays when you can start enabling MFA.\n\nIf you haven’t already previewed MFA with some of your Salesforce champions, consider starting your rollout with a small pilot. This way, you can test the rollout process and user experience. Collect feedback on what worked, what needs tweaking, and where you have gaps in resources or support so your official launch goes smoothly. You can focus your pilot on admin users, or go for a cross-section of users across teams to verify that things work well for all audiences.\n\nKnow Who Your Users Are\n\nBefore starting your rollout strategy — especially if you’re going with a phased approach — do an inventory of your existing users, including their current permissions and roles. Use this exercise to identify your admins and other privileged users, and to get other insights to help you define logical rollout groups. For tips, see Conduct a User Inventory for Your MFA Implementation.\n\nDecide Who Gets MFA First\n\nFor a phased rollout, calculate how many groups you want. Then figure out who to include in each group. Keep in mind that, as of February 1, 2022, all users who log in to the user interface, including admins, business users, contractors, partners, and external vendors, must use MFA.\n\nYour highest priority is adding an MFA requirement for all of your privileged users. There’s higher risk when an attacker gets access to these types of accounts. Start by rolling out MFA to all Salesforce admins, and to any user who can access sensitive data or change how your product operates. These types of users are Salesforce experts, so you can onboard them more quickly than others.\nNext, enable MFA for users who have critical roles or functions. Anyone who can impact your business by losing Salesforce access is a great candidate for an early group.\nConsider how and when to enable contractors, partners, and other external users who must access your Salesforce products.\nFinish up by rolling out MFA to your remaining users. Look for logical groupings, such as all users on a specific team, or everyone in a business unit or geographic location.\n\nAnd here are some additional considerations:\n\nIf you have a single sign-on (SSO) implementation, add an MFA requirement to the direct login backup accounts that admins use if SSO is unavailable.\nIf you work with third-party call centers, creative agencies, or consulting firms that need access to your Salesforce environment, plan for applying an MFA requirement to external users.\nSEE ALSO\nDetermine Business and User Requirements for MFA\nAssess Org and User Readiness for MFA\nConduct a User Inventory for Your MFA Implementation\nPreview Multi-Factor Authentication\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
