To enable this, go to Setup > Company Settings > Data Protection and Privacy, and check the Make data protection details available in records checkbox.\n\nFrom Vlocity Health and Vlocity Insurance Summer '21 release onwards, the service also supports the Person Account flow.\n\nVlocity's enrollment and census features are tightly integrated, so you can upload a census into Vlocity, create Contact records for those census members, and enroll them into plans.\n\nHere's what that looks like, with the services involved to make it happen:\n\nSmall Group Enrollment Scenarios\n\nHere's a quick look at some common small group enrollment scenarios and the personas involved in the process.\n\nBroker Enrollment\n\nA small group broker often provides personalized service for a small business owner or plan administrator by guiding them through rates, product offerings and selections, and the actual enrollment of members.\n\nEnrollment may include taking physical paper forms and entering the data from the form into a formatted file, like a CSV, in order to upload member and plan selection data.\n\nNOTE\n\nBrokers often need to manually transform the file into a standardized template, which can be a tedious effort and prone to human errors. A bulk import tool or wizard may be used to confirm eligibility, demographic information, dependents, or make plan elections.\n\nPlan Benefits Administrator\n\nIn this scenario, a small group employer is given a secure portal login and makes elections on behalf of their employees as the plan benefits administrator. This might also be performed by a third-party administrator (TPA) hired by the employer and acting on their behalf.\n\nInternal Carrier Representative\n\nA healthcare insurance company may have an internal carrier representative for the small group, who aggregates data and processes for the group.\n\nMember Portal during Open Enrollment\n\nDuring an open enrollment period, a member logs directly into the member portal and is guided through a process to make elections for their eligible plans.\n\nEnrollment Services\n\nVlocity has over a dozen enrollment and census specific services that can be used for enrollment tasks. These are grouped together in an OmniScript flow to provide a comprehensive end-to-end enrollment experience.\n\nGenerally speaking, these enrollment tasks can be broken down into three broad categories:\n\nEnroll—Load a new or updated census with plan members.\n\nRetrieve—Use census member IDs to get current enrollment plans for a member and dependents, so they can make benefit changes.\n\nModify—Allow users to add or remove applicable plans, and add or remove dependents. Users can also opt out of plans altogether.\n\nProduct Enrollment Data with a Census\n\nYou can upload product enrollment data (medical, dental, vision) with census members, either via OmniScript or spreadsheet. The services involved in that are:\n\ngetFieldsInsCensusService: getFields—Retrieves field definitions and field API names for group census members and group census plans;\n\ngetMembersWithPlansInsCensusService: getMembersWithPlans—Retrieves members of a census and their pre-enrolled plans, as well as field definitions;\n\nupdateMembersWithPlansInsCensusService: updateMembersWithPlans—Populates a census with primary members, their dependents, and their pre-enrolled plan;\n\naddPlanSelectionsInsCensusService: addPlanSelections—Inserts pre-enrolled plans for each member specified in the input;\n\nupdateMembersInsCensusService: updateMembersWithPlans—Populates a census with primary members and their dependents.\n\nThe spreadsheet census file itself can also include product enrollment information along with member and dependent data (name, birthdate, and so forth). To accommodate this, the mapper supports mapping of spreadsheet columns for products.\n\nTIP\n\nCheck out the Uploading a Census from the Census Uploader topic for full details on how to setup the OmniScript.\n\nAdd Members and Dependents\nTo associate a member for enrollment, get their User, Contact, Account, and Contract Ids by adding an Omnistudio Data Mapper as an extract action in the Script Configuration section of the OmniScript structure.\nAdding Enrollment Products\nYou need to configure the enrollment OmniScript to provide a list of all the available healthcare products.\nConfiguring Enrollment Selection Summary\nThe Selection Summary section of the enrollment OmniScript structure uses a specific template, Omnistudio Data Mapper, and remote action to configure the completion steps of the enrollment process.\nEnrollment Marketing Events\nDuring an enrollment period, you may want to create marketing events to educate and inform members about new plans, changes to plans, and so forth. For Medicare sales and group enrollment, funds can be requested for a marketing event by adding an enrollment event to an Account record.\nEnrollment Services\nThere are a number of enrollment specific services available as part of the InsEnrollmentService class.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
