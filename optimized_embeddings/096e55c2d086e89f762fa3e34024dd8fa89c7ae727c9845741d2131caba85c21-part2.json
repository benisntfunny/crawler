The path is a framework that recommends the structure and best practices for a successful transition. Use the steps that make sense for your company as you roll out Lightning Experience to your org.\n\nFor easier manageability and a faster transition, we recommend approaching things in three phases. The phases break down into a few stages, each with a set of recommended activities.\n\nDiscover\t\nLearn how Salesforce Lightning—from the platform and ecosystem to the user experience—benefits your company.\nEvaluate your org’s business priorities and technical strategy, and your org’s readiness for Lightning Experience.\nPlan for your rollout by deciding to move users in groups or all at once. Decide how to train and prepare users for the coming change and how to measure your success.\nAlign with stakeholders and executives to make the case and get the green light.\n\nRoll Out\t\nPrepare users for Lightning Experience with change management activities that educate and excite.\nImplement productivity-enhancing features that are available only in Lightning Experience to give your users a boost.\nAdjust existing customizations and features to work in Lightning Experience.\nLaunch Lightning Experience to users.\n\nOptimize\t\nMeasure that you’re hitting your goals, improving the business, and delivering what users need.\nMotivate users to adopt Lightning Experience and give up Salesforce Classic.\nIterate on your rollout plan by fixing priority issues, refining the experience, and addressing new use cases.\nTurn off Salesforce Classic for your org and call your transition finished!\n\nDon’t worry, this doesn’t have to be a massive, lengthy effort. In fact, many customers began moving users within a month or two of starting their transitions. We recommend taking an iterative, agile approach where you break up the work—and the number of users you move—into a few groups.\n\nDepending on the size of your organization, you could be working with a Change Management department or have a project manager assigned to the transition. Or perhaps you’re the one charged with organizing and executing the transition from start to finish. However the work gets divvied up, use the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant to follow the path.\n\nSEE ALSO\nMeet the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant\nVideo: Plan for a Phased Rollout (Starting with a Pilot)\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
