They can control and monitor what data gets shared with whom, without writing complex code.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions in Financial Services Cloud\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Nonprofit Cloud\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions in Public Sector Solutions\n\nCompliant Data Sharing uses a setup object and several junction objects.\n\nStandard Objects:\n\nAccount Participant: A junction object that stores a relationship between a user or participant group, a participant role, and an account record. Account participants for a record are shown in the Account Participants related list.\nOpportunity Participant: A junction object that stores a relationship between a user or participant group, a participant role, and an opportunity record. Opportunity participants for a record are shown in the Opportunity Participants related list.\n\nCustom objects:\n\nParticipant: Represents information about a participant in the context of a custom object record.\nParticipant Role: A setup object that defines an available role for a parent object and an associated data access level.\n\nControl Who Sees What with Compliant Data Sharing\nCompliant Data Sharing is an additional that Salesforce offers for sharing data.\nConfigure Your Org for Compliant Data Sharing\nConfigure your org to get the most from the advanced data sharing capabilities of the Compliant Data Sharing feature.\nManage Participant Roles in Compliant Data Sharing\nCompliant Data Sharing uses participant roles to define how users and participant groups relate to a record. Each participant role specifies the access level it grants to a record when assigned to a participant.\nConfigure Page Layouts for Compliant Data Sharing\nAdd related lists that display object participants to page layouts.\nManage Users in Compliant Data Sharing\nAssign the Compliant Data Sharing permissions and object access to users depending on their needs. After a user is assigned a participant role for a record or as a member of a participant group, they can’t be deactivated. Delete all associated junction objects and remove them from all participant groups before deactivating them.\nManage Participant Groups in Compliant Data Sharing\nCompliant Data Sharing uses participant groups to define groups of users with the same role in their record interactions.\nSet Up an Object for Public and Private Sharing in Compliant Data Sharing\nIt gets a little tricky when you want to share most records for an object publicly but that object also has some records that are visible only to some users. For example, a Grantmaking Experience Cloud site can show most funding opportunities to all users but it also has some funding opportunities that are available only by invitation and not publicly visible.\nWork with Compliant Data Sharing\nAdministrators can enable Compliant Data Sharing for Account and Opportunity objects. Administrators and compliance managers then configure data sharing roles with associated access levels to adhere to compliance with regulations and company policies. An account or opportunity record owner shares a record with other relevant users.\nConsiderations and Limitations for Compliant Data Sharing\nHere are some things to keep in mind when you implement Compliant Data Sharing (CDS).\nSEE ALSO\nCreate a Many-to-Many Relationship\nControl Who Sees What\nInteraction Summaries\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
