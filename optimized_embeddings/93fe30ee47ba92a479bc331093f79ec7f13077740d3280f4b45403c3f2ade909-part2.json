This feature can’t be disabled.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Database.com Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo view a sandbox:\tView Setup and Configuration\nTo freeze or unfreeze user accounts:\tFreeze Users or Manage Users\nWhy Is Salesforce Running This Process?\n\nSalesforce is running this process for two main reasons:\n\nSecurity—Most production users have login access to sandboxes but don’t require it. Security is improved by limiting access to only active users.\nPerformance—Inactive users impact the login experience for sandboxes. By limiting access to only active users, the login experience is faster in existing and new sandboxes.\nWho’s Impacted by This Change?\n\nUsers who have login access to a sandbox, including admins, are subject to freezing if they don’t log in within the first 60 days of the user being created in the sandbox. This change also applies to users created by the sandbox refresh process and users created by an admin in the sandbox after a sandbox was created, refreshed, or cloned. For existing sandboxes older than 60 days, users that logged in at least one time aren’t frozen.\n\nAre Any Users Exempt From the Freezing Process?\n\nNo. Any user who can log in to a sandbox is eligible for freezing. After a sandbox is created, refreshed, or cloned, users must log in within 60 days to retain access.\n\nUsers are exempted from freezing if they’ve logged in using any of these authentication methods:\n\nBasic authentication\nAPI key authentication\nOAuth 1.0\nOAuth 2.0\nWhich Sandboxes Are Impacted?\n\nThis change applies to all new and existing Dev and Dev Pro sandboxes on all instances (Salesforce first-party and Hyperforce) regardless of their creation method.\n\nNOTE This process doesn’t affect Partial Copy and Full sandboxes. We’ll provide advanced notice when we enable this feature for these sandbox types.\nCan I Opt Out of This Process?\n\nNo. Users that need access to a sandbox must log in at least one time in the 60 days following the date the user was added to the sandbox.\n\nIf I Log into the Sandbox and Don’t Log In Again for 60 or More Days, Will I Be Frozen?\n\nNo. After you log in to a sandbox, you’re exempt from being frozen when the process runs again in the future.\n\nIs There a Way to Unfreeze a User?\n\nYes. A user with access to the sandbox who has the appropriate user permissions can unfreeze other users. See Salesforce Help: Freeze or Unfreeze User Accounts for details.\n\nWhat Can I Do If All Admin Users Are Frozen? What If No One Can Access the Sandbox?\n\nWe strongly recommend that at least one admin user logs in to a sandbox after creation, refresh, or cloning. If all users with the appropriate user permissions to manage or unfreeze users are frozen, you have some options:\n\nIf the existing sandbox is outdated or not being actively used, you can refresh it. Users must log in within 60 days to retain access.\nIf you want to regain access to the existing sandbox, contact Salesforce Customer Support, who can unfreeze the desired user accounts.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Help: Freeze or Unfreeze User Accounts\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
