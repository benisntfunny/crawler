There are limits with user profiles, permissions sets, and the interaction between users with and without Chatter access.\n\nThe Enable Chatter option isn’t available on profiles or permission sets unless profile-based rollout of Chatter is enabled for the organization.\n\nWhen you enable Chatter in a permission set, the permission set takes precedence over user profile settings. All users with a Chatter-enabled permission set have access to Chatter, even if Chatter isn't enabled in their user profile.\n\nWhen you disable Chatter in a permission set, the permission set doesn't take precedence over user profile settings. All users with a Chatter-enabled user profile have access to Chatter, even if Chatter is disabled in their permission set. To prevent that person from accessing Chatter, disable Chatter in both the person's user profile and permission set.\n\nEnabling Chatter in a person's user profile or permission set doesn't automatically turn on Chatter for the organization. Turn on Chatter for your organization in Setup, after you modify user profiles and permission sets.\n\nStandard Salesforce user profiles have Chatter enabled by default. You can’t disable Chatter for these standard profiles.\n\nDon't deselect the Enable Chatter permission on a cloned Chatter External user profile. The user sees an error message and can’t log in.\n\nDon’t deselect the Enable Chatter permission on a cloned Chatter Free or Chatter Moderator profile. You get an error message and can’t save the profile.\n\nEnabling Chatter and profile-based rollout for an organization also enables a set of dependent Chatter user permissions. If Chatter is disabled for the organization, these permissions are also disabled at the same time. However, if Chatter is reenabled, these permissions aren’t automatically re-enabled, and the administrator must enable them explicitly.\n\nWhen profile-based rollout of Chatter is enabled for an organization, Chatter is automatically enabled for standard profiles. For custom profiles and permission sets, Chatter is automatically enabled if any of these user-level permissions are enabled manually or as part of a license:\n\nCreate and Own New Chatter Groups (ChatterOwnGroups)—Users with this permission can create groups in Chatter.\nCreate and Share Content Deliveries for Chatter Files (ChatterFileLink)—Users with this permission can use files with Chatter, like uploading, attaching, and sharing.\nInvite Customers To Chatter (ChatterInviteExternalUsers)—Users with this permission can invite users who don’t have a Salesforce license to Chatter.\nManage Chatter Messages and Direct Messages (ManageChatterMessages)—Users with this permission have management access to Chatter Messages and Direct Messages (Experience Builder sites).\nModerate Chatter (ModerateChatter)—Users with this permission can moderate Chatter feeds.\nModerate Chatter Feeds (ModerateNetworkFeeds)—Users with this permission can moderate feeds in sites.\nUse Case Feed (ViewCaseInteraction)—Users with this permission can access Case feeds.\nView All Data (ViewAllData)—Users with this permission can view all data, regardless of their membership status in a feed or ownership of a record.\nWhen profile-based rollout of Chatter is enabled for an organization, two org preferences are set to OFF:\nAllow Coworker Invitations (inviteCsnUserEnabled)\nAllow Customer Invitations (inviteChatterGuestEnabled)\n\nIn organizations that have thanks badges enabled, users with access to Chatter can’t thank users who don’t have access to Chatter.\n\nIf your organization already has Chatter enabled and switches to profile-based rollout of Chatter, manually enable Chatter in all existing custom profiles and permission sets. Otherwise, users that are assigned these custom profiles and permission sets lose access to Chatter.\n\nWhen profile-based rollout of Chatter is enabled in Salesforce Classic, users who can’t use Chatter also can’t use global search. Advanced search is available to these users.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
