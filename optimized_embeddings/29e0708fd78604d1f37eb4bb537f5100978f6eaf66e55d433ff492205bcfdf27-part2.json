A subdomain name is an extension of your company’s brand. When you create your subdomain, you also create your company’s first content collection—a batch of content that you want to make available to certain learners. Later, you can create more content collections in Salesforce.\nAuthentication Providers for Your Enablement Site\nAfter you set up your enablement site's subdomain, select an authentication provider, which determines how all your users—learners, content creators, and release managers—log in to your site. You can select either Salesforce Identity for Enablement, which we recommend, or Trailblazer.me (TBID). The authentication provider that you select determines the login and navigation experience for all of your users.\nAssign Permissions for Enablement Site Users\nAll your users—release managers, content creators, and learners—need the appropriate user permissions to access the appropriate features and fulfill their roles. A Salesforce admin configures user permissions in Setup in Salesforce.\nEnable External Learners for Your Enablement Site\nEnable learners from outside your company as users for your enablement site by linking an Experience Cloud site. For example, guide partners to content that teaches them how to manage leads and opportunities. Or, guide customers to content that teaches them how to use your products.\nBrand Your Enablement Site\nWhen you configure your enablement site, you can apply your company’s visual identity, such as logo, primary color, and banner image. You can also customize the links that appear in the footer of each page. And you can designate the pages where your users land when they log out or click the Help icon. These customizations persist across your enablement site.\nManage Filters for Enablement Site Content\nFilters help learners find relevant content on your enablement site. Users can apply filters to refine search results or narrow down the visible content on the Modules and Trails index pages. And, Trail Tracker users can create reports based on filters, such as a report that shows all content labeled with a particular filter.\nTrack and Assign Enablement Site Content with the Trail Tracker App\nTrail Tracker is a free app for assigning and reporting on content for your learners. The app, which is a managed package and not part of your enablement site, adds capabilities for assigning trailmixes, setting deadlines, tracking completion progress, and customizing assignment notifications. The app also provides reports and dashboards to help you get started.\nRequest to Change Your Enablement Site's Subdomain Name\nIf you want to change your enablement site’s subdomain name after it was first created, you can submit a Salesforce Customer Support case.\nSEE ALSO\nContent Lifecycle for Your Enablement Site\nTrailhead: Enablement Site Configuration\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
