The key components of Business Rules Engine are expression sets and lookup tables. Decision matrices and decision tables together constitute lookup tables.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions for Industries clouds that have Business Rules Engine enabled\n\nUse a Business Rules Engine component or a combination of components to design business rules to provide automated business solutions in a workflow created using any tool. Business Rules Engine is a suite of services, components, and objects that can be used to create business rules that perform complex lookups and calculations.\n\nBusiness Rules Engine components are available as part of Flows and OmniStudio. Also, you can use Connect APIs to integrate Business Rules Engine with any workflow created using custom or third-party tools. The workflow that you use to gather inputs passes the inputs to Business Rules Engine, which then returns the outcome to the workflow that called the Business Rules Engine component.\n\nHow Business Rules Engine Components Integrate with Workflow Tools\n\nHere's how the components in Business Rules Engine integrate and interact with workflows that are created using various tools and processes.\n\nWORKFLOW TOOL OR PROCESS\tBUSINESS RULES ENGINE INTEGRATION\nFlow\tExpression sets, decision matrices, and decision tables, which are components of Business Rules Engine, are available as actions in Flow. Invoke decision matrices and decision tables as part of an expression set that you invoke in a flow, or independently in flows.\nOmniStudio\tExpression sets and decision matrices are available as actions in OmniStudio. If Business Rules Engine is available for your cloud and you also have OmniStudio enabled, you can call Expression Set Action and Decision Matrix Action from integration procedures and OmniScripts.\nCustom or third-party tools\tUse the Connect APIs in Business Rules Engine to invoke expression sets and lookup tables in workflows that you create in custom or third-party tools.\nGet Started with Business Rules Engine\nBusiness Rules Engine lets you build powerful, scalable lookups and calculations to automate complex decisions. Rules created with Business Rule Engine are easy to maintain, and integrate directly with Flow, OmniStudio, and third-party workflow tools using connect APIs.\nLearn and Explore\nLearn how Business Rules Engine can help your business and customers. Understand its core functionality, create a trial org, and learn how to get started.\nSet Up Business Rules Engine\nConfigure your users to use Business Rules Engine and assign permission sets so that the users can access expression sets and lookup tables.\nDecision Matrices\nA decision matrix matches input values to a table row and returns the row's output values. Expression sets and various digital procedures can call decision matrices. Decision matrices accept JSON input from, and return JSON output to the digital processes that call the matrices. Decision matrices are useful for implementing complex rules in a systematic, readable manner.\nDecision Tables for Business Rules Engine\nDecision tables are complex lookup tables that read business rules with multiple inputs, and return multiple outputs for records in your Salesforce org, or for the values that you specify. Rules are records in a standard object, custom object, or a custom metadata type.\nExpression Sets\nExpression sets—the calculation engine of business rules—consist of a series of steps connected in a logical flow built from variables, constants, conditions, calculations, lookups, and aggregations. Expression sets accept JSON input from and return JSON output to the digital processes that call the sets.\nDecision Explainer for Expression Sets\nUse Decision Explainer with Business Rules Engine to show your users explanations for the results of steps in an expression set, and to capture action logs for expression set runs. Store explanations for expression steps in explainability message templates. And then add the templates to your expression set steps for which you want to show explanations. When you simulate the expression set version, switch to the Concise view option to preview how your users see the explanations.\nBusiness Rules Engine Integrations\nExpression sets and lookup tables—the Business Rules Engine components—can be called from Flow and Omnistudio. You can also use Business Rules Engine Business APIs to call these components from workflows that are created by using third-party tools.\nCalculation Matrix and Procedure Migration to Business Rules Engine\nTo use calculation procedures and calculation matrices from OmniStudio as Business Rules Engine components, migrate these OmniStudio components as expression sets and decision matrices. To migrate a calculation procedure as an expression set, and a calculation matrix as a decision matrix, use the CalculationMatrixMigrationService and CalculationProcedureMigrationService Apex classes.\nBusiness Rules Engine Default Limits\nReview the default limits for Business Rules Engine components and their usage. If your business requires any default limits to be raised, contact Salesforce Customer Support for further guidance.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
