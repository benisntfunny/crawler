Links and other resources help you link cart to cash.\n\nBest Practices\n\nInvoice Integration Between B2B and Billing\n\nWe recommend that you directly surface the billing invoices in the B2B Storefront, rather than synchronize the invoices between B2B Invoice and Billing Invoice objects.\nUse a custom component that surfaces the invoices and payments directly from Salesforce Billing to the B2B storefront.\n\nBilling-Related Data Capture at Sign Up or Check Out\n\nFrequency, Method\nBilling contact info\nAll subscription (terms, length, and so on) at sign up or check out\n\nInvoice Integration Between B2B and Billing\n\nUse the B2B Commerce data model flow “CC Invoice” and “CC Payment” objects to capture the Invoice and Payment details.\n\nSalesforce Billing Fields\n\nWe recommend that you don’t synchronize the “CC Invoice” and “CC Payment” objects with “Invoice” and “Payment” objects in Salesforce Billing.\n\nKey Considerations\n\nCybersource Marketplace Template\n\nIf you’re using the Cybersource marketplace template available on the out-of-box B2B storefront, set the “Auth and Capture” value to “False”.\n\nStorefront Guest User Access Orders\n\nIf the storefront allows unregistered users to check out, add the necessary Apex class permissions to your community’s guest user profile.\n\nPerformance and Scalability Considerations\n\nERP Integrations\n\nThis model lets the user extend functionality to an ERP or any backend system for enhanced revenue recognition or fulfillment.\nWhen activated, the Order object is the trigger point when sending any order information to an external system. It’s also the entry point back when updating any fulfillment-level details.\nImplement the Order-to-Cash (OTC) integration between Salesforce Billing and the underlying ERP. It’s the single source of truth for orders, invoices, and electronic payments regardless of whether it originated in B2B or CPQ.\nIntegrating OTC with B2B isn’t necessary.\n\nTax Integration\n\nIf using an external tax engine like Avalara, Vertex, or Sabrix, integrate B2B and Billing with the tax engine to avoid any discrepancies.\n\nPricing\n\nWhether the order amounts come from a B2B (self-service) or CPQ (sales rep) transaction, ensure that the orders match.\n\nWe recommend that you set the rounding precision to two decimal places. This precision must be the same in both B2B and CPQ.\nA self-service B2B order automatically creates CPQ Orders. The net price from the B2B Order publishes and discounts as the “Special Price” and “Net Price” on the CPQ Quote Lines.\n\nEnsure that any price rules in CPQ ignore the B2B system-generated quotes as part of the self-service flow. Track it by adding a custom attribute on the Quoting object. For example, “Quote_Source__c” → B2B. Check for this value in all Price Rules or Quote Calculator Plugin (QCP) customizations.\n\nBilling and Charge Types\n\nSet up the Billing and Charge types to have the same values between B2B and CPQ for any supported products that use these cross-cloud scenarios.\n\nSee Also\nCPQ | B2B Connector Setup and Implementation Guide\nB2B Commerce Data Model\nSalesforce Billing Hosted Payment Page\nCyberSource for B2B Commerce\nSalesforce Order Data Model\nRelated Content\n\t\n\nReview earlier steps in this solution.\n\nWorkflow\n\n\t\n\nTake the next steps in this implementation.\n\nConnector\nConfigurations\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
