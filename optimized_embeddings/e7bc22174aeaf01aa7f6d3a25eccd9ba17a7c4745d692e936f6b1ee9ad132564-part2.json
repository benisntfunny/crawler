Use the connector and other required products to synchronize product and pricing data\n\nAvoid Duplicating All Data Between the B2B Commerce and CPQ Clouds\n\nWe recommend that you enrich B2B Commerce-specific metadata in B2B only. Don’t replicate on the core Product2 object. Examples are B2B Product Categories, Product Images, and SEO-related information.\n\nTest Data Strategy and Use a Partial or Full Sandbox\n\nTest connector and data synchronization from a sandbox environment. Don’t start by completing the process from a Production Instance.\n\nCreate Reports with a Custom Report Type for the CPQB2B Log Object\n\nMonitor performance and effectively swarm issues that affect the customer shopping experience.\nMonitor and manage the Error Logs and LastSync_Date__c field.\n\nDatabase of Record (DBOR)\n\nMake updates to the core metadata only in CPQ. The connector doesn’t use a bi-directional sync between B2B Commerce and CPQ.\n\nFollow the following sequence to update:\n\nUpdate to CPQ standard objects.\nSync to CC objects.\nRun product index in B2B. Ensure that all integrations, scheduled loads, and related actions follow the data flow sequence. Align data between CPQ and B2B, and share with external community users.\n\nProduct Index Monitoring\n\nManually refresh your index at any time. Schedule the Batch Apex Jobs to automatically run from the Apex Jobs Queue.\n\nKey Considerations\n\nLocalization\n\nThe connector doesn’t currently handle localization. To localize, customize the unmanaged package for the connector. It uses a storefront localization Product i18n object.\n\nMulti-Currency Price books\n\nFor pricing, publish Currency ISO Code on the Commerce Price List data model, “CC Price Lists”. It uses a Commerce Price List data model.\n\nCommerce uses one currency in the CC Price Lists mappings to support price books as multi-currency.\nThis links CC Price List currency as items to accommodate a multi-currency path. For example, if a Price book has USD and CAD prices and links to a USD currency CC Price List, it syncs only USD prices. To sync the two prices, the user must create a second CC Price List with CAD currency.\nLimitations and Guardrails\n\nBusiness requirements rely on modifications to the code in the package.\n\nCustomize package and object configurations to support more CPQ functionality and CPQ Product Types:\n\nContract Pricing Sync.\nManaging Kits, Dynamic Kits, and Product Bundles for CC Commerce.\nManaging Tier Pricing for CC Commerce Products.\nSupporting Percent of Total Products in CC Commerce.\nA payment integration or implementation is necessary and not included in the connector.\nB2B Commerce assumes that a certain level of information exists for order details. Customize the B2B order page or sync other shipping and payment information. The Connector doesn’t sync them.\n\nB2B Commerce to CPQ Connector currently syncs core product and pricing objects between CPQ and B2B. It doesn’t support Contract Pricing sync, but you can extend them with customizations.\n\nContract Pricing\n\nSBQQ__CONTRACTEDPRICE\tCC PRICE GROUP ACCOUNT\tCC PRICE GROUP\nCC_LastSyncDate__c\tSBQQ__Contracted_Price_Id__c\tSBQQ__Contracted_Price_Id__c\nSBQQ__CONTRACTEDPRICE\tCC PRICE GROUP ITEM\tCC PRICE GROUP PRICELIST\nCC_LastSyncDate__c\tSBQQ__Contracted_Price_Id__c\tSBQQ__Contracted_Price_Id__c\n\nRelated Solution Kits cover key mapping fields for objects.\n\nPerformance and Scalability Considerations\nWhen the Product and Pricing sync completes, it enriches B2B Commerce-specific metadata like SEO and Product Categories in B2B Commerce.\nData Syncing processes run regardless of CPQ and B2B permissions. It includes permissions added to users who modify metadata in Salesforce CPQ after the connector setup.\nRefer to the Implementation Guide Technical section for instructions on code modifications required to support the desired automation requirements.\nDATA SYNC\tAPPROACH\nProducts and Pricing\t\nPlatform Events\nScheduled Batch Classes\nQueue-able Framework\nRelated Content\n\t\n\nReview earlier steps in this solution.\n\nWorkflow\n\n\t\n\nTake the next steps in this implementation.\n\nConnector\nConfigurations\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
