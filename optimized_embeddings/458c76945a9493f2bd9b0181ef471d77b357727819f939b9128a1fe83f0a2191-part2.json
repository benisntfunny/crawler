When that happens, you see Manual (More Details) in the Conversion Type column. Here’s what to do next.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS OR FEATURES\nNEEDED\nTo run the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter:\tCustomize Application, Modify All Data\n\nWhen you click Manual (More Details) and the button isn’t supported, you get a message that you can’t covert the item.\n\nIf your button or link matches one of the common archetypes, such as a dialog or urlHack, the message recommends one or more components in the Sample Components for Lightning Component Actions repo on GitHub. This repo contains sample Lightning component bundles that represent some of the most common JavaScript button use cases. They’ve been created with extra annotation to help you configure them to your own needs.\n\nYou don’t need a GitHub login to access the repo, and you can install the components in your org using an unmanaged package.\n\nTIP Admins, you can do it! Installing the Lightning components from GitHub takes only a few clicks.\nDetermine what your comfort level with code is.\nIf the thought of working with code makes you break out in a cold sweat, and you don’t have anyone to help you, fear not! We’re not going to abandon you. First, note which components the converter recommended. Install the components in your org. Then post your issue on the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter Trailblazer Community. The folks there would be glad to help you.\nIf you’re not comfortable with code, but you have a developer that can help you, install the component bundle unmanaged package from GitHub. You can then work through it together.\nIf you’re comfortable with code, go to the GitHub repo, and look at the available components. Scroll through the Classes & Components list, and see which of the recommended components is similar to what your JavaScript button does. Install the component bundle unmanaged package in your org.\n\nReady to install the components? Let’s go.\n\nMake sure that you’re logged in to the Salesforce sandbox or Developer Edition org that you want to use to work on the button conversion.\nWe recommend not installing these components in your production org.\nGo to the home page for the component bundle on GitHub.\nIn the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter, clicking a link in the Manual (More Details) dialog brings you directly into a component file in GitHub. Navigate to the top level by clicking LEXComponentsBundle in the directory structure breadcrumb.\nOtherwise, open a new browser tab, and go to https://github.com/developerforce/LEXComponentsBundle.\nScroll down the page until you find the Click here to install link, and click it.\nIf you’re asked, log in with your org credentials.\nLeave the settings as they are, and click Install.\nThe installation can take a few moments.\nWhen the installation finishes, click Done.\nTo find the installed components, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Components, and then click Lightning Components.\nNot going to customize the code yourself? Get help to make it happen, and skip to the last step. Otherwise, read on.\nClick the name of the component that you want to configure, and then click Developer Console.\nUpdate the component code to match the functionality of the JavaScript button or link that it’s replacing.\nWhen the updated Lightning component is ready to use, create a Lightning component quick action to trigger it.\nGo to the affected page layout in Setup. Find the Lightning component quick action that you created in the palette, and add it to the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section of the page layout.\nYou can find Lightning component actions in the palette under Mobile & Lightning Actions.\nSEE ALSO\nLightning Component Actions\nScan Your Org for Updates with the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter\nJavaScript Button and Link Conversion and Deployment Behavior\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
