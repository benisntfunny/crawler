Learn more about how an enablement site can help.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\nExample Use Cases for an Enablement Site\nAdding an enablement site to your company’s resources can help support both internal and external users, whose success is critical for achieving your business goals.\nCompare an Enablement Site and Trailhead\nTrailhead is a free, online learning platform that’s a fun, engaging way for anyone to learn new skills and earn career credentials. Trailhead consists of a library of content that Salesforce has produced, intended to help anyone learn in-demand technical, business, and soft skills. With an enablement site, your company can implement that same platform on a separate, branded subdomain, and then deliver original content that fulfills your company’s learning requirements.\nUser Roles for an Enablement Site\nUsers in different roles engage with your enablement site throughout the content lifecycle. Depending on your company’s size and available talent, users can perform more than one role.\nContent Lifecycle for Your Enablement Site\nCreating and publishing content for your enablement site involves multiple disciplines that collaborate to plan, write, style, store, and release the content.\nSupported Browsers and Apps for Enablement Sites\nTo help ensure that your company’s enablement experience is successful, learn about the different options for accessing content in the flow of work.\nExternal Tools and Dependencies for an Enablement Site\nTo create and publish content, your company relies on a few resources outside of your enablement site.\nLimits for Enablement Site Data\nWe restrict the size of certain data in your enablement site, such as an image file or the scope of trailmixes. As you add learning content to your enablement site, consider these limits to help you deliver a successful learning experience.\nSandbox Support for Enablement Sites\nEnablement sites and associated tools, such as the Trail Tracker app, have limited support in a sandbox.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
