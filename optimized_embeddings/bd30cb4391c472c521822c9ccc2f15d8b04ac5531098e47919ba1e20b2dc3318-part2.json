However; viruses and variants are still around, new treatments and tests are being developed, and guidelines and recommendations change constantly and can vary by region.\n\nTo ensure the safety of workers and event attendees, you need a health verification process that is flexible, reliable, and verifiable.\n\nWith Safety Cloud Health Verification, you can:\n\nCreate Health Verification forms that are relevant and specific to an Occasion and which present and collect the required criteria for participating in or attending the occasion.\nSet a window of time for access and QR code generation based on a comparative date-time analysis of the occasion date and a laboratory test date.\nCustomize labels and add company logos or other images to your Health Verification form.\nSet up and define Occasion-specific email communications for employees and event attendees.\nOccasions and the Occasion Object\n\nIn Safety Cloud, events such as a company kickoff or remote employees returning to the workplace, are referred to as Occasions. Because health requirements can vary by Occasion, you need the flexibility to create occasion-specific health verifications. With the Safety Cloud Occasion Object data model, you can run and manage Health Verifications for each Occasion simultaneously from a single org.\n\nIn Safety Cloud, Health Verification configurations consist of an Occasion object and its child objects.\n\nThe child objects include the configuration settings that control various aspects of Health Verification for the Occasion. Aspects such as the layout of the Health Verification form, criteria for generating QR codes to access an event, and email communications with event attendees.\n\nTo create Health Verification for an Occasion, you must configure the Occasion Object and its associated child objects, as explained in these Salesforce Help articles.\n\nCreate an Occasion\nUse the Occasion Object that comes with Safety Cloud to create Health Verification configurations specific to an event.\nCreate an Occasion Setting\nUse Occasion Settings to specify the details of the Health Verification form and the Health Verification records that Safety Cloud creates when a user submits the form.\nCreate Occasion Access Settings\nUse Occasion Access Settings to specify the date range for which the QR code is valid. Also use it to specify the type of test or vaccination combinations required for generating a QR code URL and adding it to the Health Verification record.\nSet up a Digital Experience Site with the Health Verification Form\nThe Safety Cloud Template package includes an LWC component that contains the Health Verification form. If you installed the Template Package, you must set up the Digital Experience to host the LWC component on an unauthenticated site so your users can access it.\nSEE ALSO\nDefine the Send Definitions Configured in Marketing Cloud Engagement\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
