To provide localized versions of your learning content for supported languages, work with a localization team or vendor.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER ROLES\nThis topic supports these enablement site roles:\t\nRelease Managers\nLocalization Team or Vendor\nConsiderations for Languages on Your Enablement Site\nThe default language for any enablement site is English, but other languages are supported. A user can select a different language, but the extent to which content is available for any language depends on whether you’ve localized and published content for that language.\nGive Content Files to a Localization Team or Vendor\nTo add localized content, send the backpack to your localization team or vendor. The backpack is a ZIP file, downloaded from Trailmaker, that contains the module or trail’s source files. You can send the backpack ZIP file or give the vendor access to your version control system (VCS) to download the backpack. After the vendor translates your content, the vendor can upload the backpack—updated with the localized files—to your VCS. Then, you can publish the localized content.\nGuidelines for Localizing Files in a Backpack\nYour localization team or vendor can localize only certain trail, module, unit, and quiz information in your backpack’s files.\nPreview and Publish Localized Content\nAfter you receive the localized backpack and confirm that the appropriate updates are complete, set up a release and preview the translated content. Then, publish the release.\nTroubleshoot Localized Content That Appears in the Wrong Language\nDid you localize enablement site content for a particular language and a user selected that language, but the content still appears in the source language? Most likely, the number of units in a module differs between the source and localized files. When content isn’t available for a selected language, an enablement site falls back to the source language. To resolve this issue, work with your localization team or vendor to correct the number of units in a module in the localized files.\nSEE ALSO\nConsiderations for Languages on Your Enablement Site\nBackpacks for Trails and Modules\nMetadata for Trails, Modules, and Units\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
