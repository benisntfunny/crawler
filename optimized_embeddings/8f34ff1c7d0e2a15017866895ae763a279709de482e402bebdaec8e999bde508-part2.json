You can install DevOps Center in the org that is the final release org in your pipeline, or in another org that is unrelated to the orgs in the pipeline.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Professional, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\nAvailable in: Government Cloud Plus as interoperable. Turning on DevOps Center in Government Cloud Plus orgs can send data outside the authorization boundary. Contact your Salesforce account executive for more details.\nNot available in: EU Operating Zone. EU Operating zone is a special paid offering that provides an enhanced level of data residency commitment. DevOps Center is supported in orgs in the EU that aren’t part of EU OZ, per standard product terms and conditions.\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo install and configure DevOps Center:\t“Download AppExchange Packages”\n\nTo install DevOps Center in a Professional Edition org, the org must have API access, which enables DevOps Center to access data from the source control system. If you attempt to install DevOps Center in a Professional Edition org without API access, an installation error occurs. Contact your Account Executive to request the API add-on.\n\nIMPORTANT You can’t install DevOps Center in a sandbox.\nFrom Setup, enter DevOps Center in the Quick Find box, then select DevOps Center.\n\nIf you don’t see DevOps Center as an option under Setup in your Developer Edition org, it’s likely that the DE org was created before DevOps Center was introduced and doesn’t have the correct permissions. To continue, create another Developer Edition org.\n\nEnable DevOps Center, and then review and accept the license agreement, which allows you to install the package.\n\nYou can disable the preference at any time. Disabling the preference means that you can’t install the app or updates. If DevOps Center is already installed, disabling the preference prevents access to the DevOps Center application.\n\nClick Install Package.\n\nAfter the installer launches, you’re guided through the installation process to install the latest version of the DevOps Center managed package. You can come back to this Setup page to reinstall or upgrade the package.\n\nSelect Install for Admins Only, and then click Install.\nApprove third-party access to login.salesforce.com and test.salesforce.com.\n\nNext, create the connected app so that DevOps Center appears in App Launcher, then be sure to assign the appropriate DevOps Center permission sets to each team member.\n\nConfirm DevOps Center Package Installation\nWhen installation is complete, you receive a confirmation email. You can confirm the installation on the Installed Packages Setup page.\nCreate the Connected App\nThe connected app provides access to DevOps Center in the App Launcher. The DevOps Center app appears in App Launcher after users are assigned the appropriate DevOps Center permission sets.\nAdd Team Members as Users in the DevOps Center Org\nAdd any team members who aren’t already users in the DevOps Center org. For each team member, specify the appropriate license and profile based on their role.\nAssign the DevOps Center Permission Sets\nAssign permission sets to everyone working on your project in DevOps Center. Consider who must change project-level settings (such as adding another work environment) and who needs access to only work items.\nConfigure Session Settings\nDue to the underlying technologies that support creating sessions that allow DevOps Center to interact with multiple environments in a project’s pipeline, IP addresses aren’t static. Therefore, you must disable the session setting, Lock sessions to the IP address from which they originated, to avoid seeing errors when attempting to commit and promote changes.\nDisable API Access Control Setting for Allowlisted Connected Apps\nFor orgs with API Access Control settings enabled by Salesforce Support, you must disable the “For admin-approved users, limit API access to only allowlisted connected apps” because this setting blocks DevOps Center from interacting with required APIs.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
