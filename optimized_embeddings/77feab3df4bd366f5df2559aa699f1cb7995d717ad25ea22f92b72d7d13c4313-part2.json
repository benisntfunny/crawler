The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough lead data, Einstein builds a scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\n\nEinstein Opportunity Scoring\nYou must have at least 200 closed won opportunities in last 24 months, each with a lifespan of at least 2 days.\nYou must have at least 200 closed lost opportunities in last 24 months, each with a lifespan of at least 2 days.\nOpportunity history shows an average of one update to each closed opportunity.\nUse the standard opportunity Stage field because it’s used to calculate win rates, and win rates are used to generate scores. If you change the names of the opportunity stage picklist values, make sure that the values are mapped to the correct stage type: Open, Closed/Won. or Closed/Lost.\nIf your win rate is extremely high or low, your scores could be skewed. For example, if your win rate is above 90 percent, you could get a large number of opportunities with scores above 90. To avoid skewed scores, make sure that opportunities are set to the correct closed stage. (A win rate is calculated by dividing the last two years of closed-won opportunities by all closed opportunities from that same period.)\n\nIf you don’t have enough opportunity data to build your own predictive model, Einstein uses a global model. The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough opportunity data, Einstein builds a scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\n\nEinstein Forecasting\nCollaborative Forecasts must be enabled.\nYou must work with opportunities in Salesforce for at least 12 months. Specifically, the opportunity history must show at least one update in each of the past 12 months.\nYou must use a standard fiscal year. Standard fiscal years follow the Gregorian calendar, but can start on the first day of any month of the year.\nForecasts must be measured by opportunity revenue. Predictions are generated for only the oldest activated opportunity revenue forecast type.\nYour forecast hierarchy must include at least one forecasting enabled user who reports to a forecast manager.\nThe Amount field should be populated in at least 80 percent of open opportunities.\nSEE ALSO\nConsiderations for Setting Up Sales Cloud Einstein\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
