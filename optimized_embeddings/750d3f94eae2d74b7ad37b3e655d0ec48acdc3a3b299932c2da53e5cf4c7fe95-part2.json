Check out the catalogs for our other products:\n\nCommerce Cloud B2C\nMarketing Cloud Engagement\nSales, Service, Community, Chatter, and Platform\nTableau Cloud\n\n⏮ Back to Proactive Services: Monitoring Overview\n\n\n\nThe Signature Success Plan comes with Proactive Services and Smart Alerts that will notify you in real-time when your custom Salesforce solution has inefficiencies, application performance degradations, or errors.\n\n\nHere's a list of the current Smart Alerts available through Proactive Services, including their technical descriptions, business impacts, and the insights you will get from each one.\n\n \n\n \n\nResolution\nErrors\n\n \n\nData Stream Failures\nFile Processing Failures\nProvider Data Retrieval Failures\nReport Consumption Failures\nTechnical Data Retrieval Failures\nWidget Load Failures\nWorkspace Failures\n\n \n\nSmart Alert Technical Descriptions, Business Impacts, and Insights Delivered\n\n \n\nCategory\tName\tTechnical Description\tBusiness Impacts & Proactive Insights Delivered\nErrors\tData Stream Failures\tAlerts on any data stream failures that occur in the time period being measured. Data stream jobs are any instance in which data is processed for the data stream.*\tData streams enable users to upload data for reference throughout the MCI platform. Identifying errors is crucial, as data streams serve as the primary means for users to import data into MCI, forming the cornerstone of any MCI instance.\nErrors\tFile Processing Failures\tData streams allow users to perform file batch processing (end-to-end of a single ETL process). This monitor alerts if a platform error occurs during the file processing stage.\tFile processing is linked with the data stream entity in MCI. When file processing errors occur, data may fail to upload or be fetched/retrieved.\nErrors\tProvider Data Retrieval Failures\tUsers can retrieve data from supported data sources. This monitor will alert if there was a platform error during the data stream retrievals process when fetching/retrieving data.*\tProvider data retrievals are tied to the data stream entity in MCI. If an alert is triggered, it indicates that the data stream job failed to fetch/retrieve data from the specified data source.\nErrors\tReport Consumption Failures\tReports are used to retrieve, view, and share a detailed analysis of the data that has been integrated into MCI. This monitor alerts if a platform error occurs during the execution of a scheduled report.\tReports are integral to the Analyze & Act page of MCI. When report consumption errors arise, it indicates that the scheduled report failed to complete, resulting in the unavailability of accurate, up-to-date data.\nErrors\tTechnical Data Retrieval Failures\tUsers can retrieve data from supported data sources. This monitor will alert if there was a platform error during the delivery provider's retrieval process when fetching/retrieving data in a data stream (coming from technical vendors).*\tTechnical data retrievals are linked with the data stream entity in MCI. Identifying errors is crucial, as any failure during the delivery provider's retrieval process prevents the fetching or retrieval of data from a data stream.\nErrors\tWidget Load Failures\tWidgets are the graphic elements that appear on the page and display your data through pie charts, tables, bar graphs, etc. This monitor will alert when a platform error occurs while attempting to load a widget.\tWidgets are integral components of the Visualize page in MCI. In the event of a widget load failure, essential graphs, charts, and other visual elements cannot be loaded, thereby hindering users' ability to analyze data effectively.\nErrors\tWorkspace Failures\tEach MCI account can have multiple workspace, which contains its own data streams, dashboards, and reports. This monitor will alert if a workspace fails to create, read, update, or delete.\tWorkspaces encompass all entities within MCI. Identifying errors is paramount, particularly when they affect the creation, reading, updating, or deletion (CRUD) operations within the workspace.\n \n\nSalesforce may change the Proactive Monitoring, Smart Alert Catalog from time to time in its sole discretion. SFDC will provide customers with advance notice of any planned downtime.\n\n \n\n* Refer to the descriptions below for further clarification on the differentiation between data retrievals and data streams:\n\nData Retrieval:\nData retrieval refers to the process of obtaining or fetching data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, external systems, etc.\nIn the context of MCI, data retrieval involves accessing and importing data from different sources into the Marketing Cloud platform for analysis, segmentation, personalization, and other marketing activities.\nThis could include retrieving customer data from CRM systems, transactional data from e-commerce platforms, engagement data from email service providers, and more.\nData Stream:\nA data stream in MCI represents a flow of data from a specific source into the Marketing Cloud platform.\nData streams serve as a conduit for data ingestion, enabling marketers to leverage data for their campaigns and analytics.\nThey are often configured to automatically pull data from external sources, such as event logs, website interactions, IoT devices, etc., and feed it into Marketing Cloud for processing and analysis.\nIn summary, while data retrieval focuses on fetching data from various sources for use within Marketing Cloud, data streams specifically pertain to the flow of data from external sources into the platform for processing and action.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKnowledge Article Number\n\n001356620\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
