After you determine where the failure occurred, you can fix it.\n\nThe promotion process comprises two main steps: deploying the selected metadata to the target stage’s org, and pushing the merged metadata to the target stage’s branch. A stalled promotion can occur when updates from external services back to DevOps Center get interrupted during one of these operations. This communication breakdown results in one of these types of stalled promotions:\n\nPromotion failed–the changes weren’t promoted to either the target pipeline environment or the associated target pipeline branch. To fix the issue, execute a query to find the affected record, then change the Status to Error so you can try the promotion again.\nPromotion succeeded–the changes were promoted to both the target pipeline environment and the associated target pipeline branch, but weren’t properly reflected in DevOps Center. To fix the issue, execute a query to find the affected record, then change to Status to Completed.\nDeployment succeeded but the branch wasn’t merged–the changes exist in the target pipeline environment but don’t appear in the associated target pipeline branch. To fix the issue, execute a query to find the affected record, then change the status to Error so you can try the promotion again.\n\nTo determine how to proceed to fix the stalled promotion, first troubleshoot to discover where the error occurred.\n\nLog in to the target org and check the deployment status.\n\nFrom Setup, type Deployment Status, then select Deployment Status.\n\nCheck to see if the deployment failed.\nIf the deployment failed, reset the status of the work item and try again. See Fix a Stall Promotion When the Promotion Failed for instructions.\nIf the deployment succeeded, continue to the next step.\nIf the deployment succeeded, check to see if the pull (change) request in the source control system was merged.\nView the pull request in GitHub. If you see the Stalled Promotion error, you can use the dropdown to view the change request. If the promotion message says “Pushing,” the dropdown menu is disabled. Go to GitHub directly and select the project repository to see the list of change requests.\nClick Pull Requests.\nIf all the pull requests are closed, the promotion was successful but not properly reflected in DevOps Center. See Fix a Stalled Promotion when the Promotion Succeeded for instructions. If you see open pull requests, continue to the next step.\nLook for the pull requests associated with your stalled promotion.\nIf you attempted to promote all work items in the stage, look for a pull request with the title that begins with [DO NOT MERGE] For DevOps Center use only - <source stage> to <target stage>.\nIf you selected a subset of items to promote, look at each pull request that contains the work item ID, for example, [DevOps Center] Merge WI-000002 to <target stage>.\nIf you attempted to promote a work item bundle, look for the pull request with the associated source and target stage, for example, [DevOps Center] <source stage> to <target stage>.\nDetermine what to do next.\nIf all the associated pull requests are merged (closed), see Fix a Stalled Promotion when the Promotion Succeeded for instructions.\nIf any of the associated pull requests weren’t merged (still open), update the status of the promotion record and try the promotion again. See Fix a Stalled Promotion When Deployment Succeeds But Merging to Branch Fails for instructions.\nFix a Stalled Promotion When the Promotion Failed\nAfter you determine that your stalled promotion is due to a failure, update the status of the record and try the promotion again.\nFix a Stalled Promotion When the Promotion Succeeded\nAfter you determine that the stalled promotion was successful but not property reflected in DevOps Center, update the status of the Async Operation Result record to update the results in DevOps Center.\nFix a Stalled Promotion When Deployment Succeeds But Merge to Branch Fails\nAfter you determine that the deployment succeeded but the changes aren’t reflected in the associated pipeline branch, update the status of the Async Operation Result record, then try the promotion again.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
