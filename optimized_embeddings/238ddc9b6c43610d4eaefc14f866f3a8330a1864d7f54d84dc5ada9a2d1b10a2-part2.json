Track these details at any point in time, and also when they’re finalized. Recalculate payouts if necessary. Adjust payouts as required and submit them for approval.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions that have Rebate Management enabled\nView Aggregated Payout Information\nPayouts are calculated for each record in the aggregate object. The admin can either use the default Rebate Member Product Aggregate object to store aggregate records, or create a custom object for the purpose. The aggregate values get updated each time a Data Processing Engine is run to process the transactions as defined in a rebate type. Track the aggregate records to view the total transaction quantity, total transaction amount, and other details for each rebate type for a member in a specific payout period.\nView Program Member Payout Details\nAfter an admin configures the payout calculation schedule, payouts are calculated and created as Rebate Program Member Payout records. Rebate payouts are created in the Program Rebate Type Payout Source, Program Rebate Type Payout, and the Rebate Program Member Payout objects. Program managers can also view the payout details in the Member Payouts related list of Rebate Program Payout Period records.\nRecalculate Payouts for Closed Periods\nRecalculate payouts for past periods or for periods when you need a recalculation due to changes in incentive structure. The rebate flows run at regular intervals to calculate payouts for all active periods. On the payout calculation date, the payout period is set to Closed and associated member payouts are set to Calculated. To reconsider such periods for payout processing, modify the payout records and run the flow again.\nAdjust Payout Amounts\nAdjust payout amounts for a member and get the updates approved. Program managers can adjust the system-calculated payout amount for a period to reverse or roll back the payouts for a member. Typical use cases include changes in incentive terms, or when the payout amounts are adjusted for other amounts such as enrollment fee, or previous balance. Adjustments can be submitted for approval using the standard approval flow.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
