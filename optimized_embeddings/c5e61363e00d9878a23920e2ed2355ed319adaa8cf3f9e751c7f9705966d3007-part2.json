Learn with Trailhead.\n\nB2B Solution Architecture with Key Salesforce Clouds\n\nThe Salesforce B2B architecture runs on two highly scalable and interoperable platforms: Salesforce and Marketing.\n\nProducts built on the Salesforce Platform (1) include Sales, Service, CPQ, B2B Commerce, Manufacturing, and Experience. They all run on the same logical platform and share a common interoperable data model.\nAPIs enable integration with other Salesforce and non-Salesforce platforms.\nThe Salesforce Platform can be used for customer and consent management, or it can integrate with a third-party Master Data Management system.\nMarketing Platform (2) is a grouping of Marketing Automation products designed for interoperability.\nDatorama organizes deep marketing analytics.\nInteraction Studio provides real-time interaction management, personalization, and AI driven recommendations.\nSocial Studio includes social monitoring and interaction.\nMarketing Cloud Account Engagement (Pardot) offers powerful marketing automation to help marketing and sales teams find and nurture the best leads, close more deals, and maximize ROI.\nAdvertising Studio enables you to use your first-party data to shape and guide your advertising.\nAudience Studio helps companies offer their customer a personalized advertising and media experience based on segmentation and audience insights.\nJourney Builder delivers cross-channel personalized experiences at every step of the customer lifecycle with campaign management.\nMuleSoft Anypoint Platform (3) provides API management and system-to-system integration.\nMuleSoft can integrate third-party systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Product Information Management (PIM), and Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) with Salesforce.\nTableau provides business intelligence analytics independent of data source.\n\nConnectors enable the connectivity that allows cross-cloud actions required to support sophisticated use cases such as handling abandoned carts and personalized marketing recommendations.\n\nB2B Solution Architecture with Salesforce Connectors\n\nConnectors are point-to-point connections provided by Salesforce that accelerate implementations across applications and cloud platforms.\n\nMarketing Cloud Connect (1) connects Marketing platform products with Sales and Service Cloud products. The connector allows data to sync between clouds. It also allows Marketing Cloud products to trigger events such as emails and journeys based on Sales and Service Cloud data.\n\nAutomatically sync data from Sales or Service Cloud to Marketing Cloud.\nConnect Journey Builder to other clouds.\nUse Sales and Service Cloud data to construct email.\nProvide Marketing Cloud email tracking data such to Sales and Service Cloud products.\n\nDistributed Marketing (2) allows users in Sales and Service Clouds to view, personalize, and send on-brand, best practice content through Marketing Cloud.\n\nUse data stored in contact, lead, or person account records to address emails.\nCraft email to a segment of customers based on a list view.\nSend email about a campaign to a group of customers based on a touchpoint cadence managed by Marketing Cloud.\n\nSocial Customer Service (3) turns social network posts into case or lead records.\n\nHeroku Connect (4) syncs data between the Heroku app platform and the core platform.\n\nCreate a data lake.\nBuild, deploy, and monitor other highly scalable customer-facing mobile and web applications.\nB2B Solution Architecture with Global Party ID (GPID)\n\nCustomer 360 Data Manager identifies the same customer across different systems using rules that you define to combine the data into a single Global Profile and Global Party ID (GPID). Unlike a Connector, Data Manager doesn’t provide mechanisms for activating functionality in integrated systems.\n\nVarious key use cases can be implemented by using Connectors and Customer 360 Data Manager together.\n\nUse Cases Initiated from Core\n\nExplore Cross-Cloud Engagement Data Models\nDistributed Marketing\nEnable Sales to engage Customer with Marketing Campaigns\n\nUse Cases Initiated from CPQ to Commerce\n\nSynchronize Product and Pricing Data\nLink Cart to Quote\nLink Cart to Cash\n\nUse Cases Initiated from Marketing\n\nTurn Social Media Posts into Leads and Cases\nRun Conversational Campaigns with WhatsApp\nRun Conversational Campaigns with SMS\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Architectural Diagrams: Quick Look\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
