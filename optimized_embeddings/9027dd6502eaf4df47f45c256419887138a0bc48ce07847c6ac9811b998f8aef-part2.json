With this feature, you can automate large parts of your operations, such as scheduling recurring visits and managing care resource assignments.\n\nManage Users and Field Operations\nGet to know the different users of Home Health and the field-level operations involved in home visits.\nManage Patient Preferences with Home Health\nPatients can prefer home visits from care professionals with specific skills. Assigning care resources that match these preferences enhances the overall experience that patients have with your organization’s services. For example, a patient prefers someone who speaks Spanish and is skilled in elder care. You can record these preferences if your admin has set up these preference types in your org.\nManage Home Visits and Authorizations\nLearn how home visits are scheduled and assigned to care resources, then learn about the prior authorization and patient eligibility verification workflows that can expedite and streamline your home visit operations.\nManage Electronic Verification of Home Visits\nHome Health’s comprehensive solution for Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) allows a home health agency to track care resource visits and verify that a patient receives the services authorized in their plans of care. This verification gives accurate and up-to-date visit data that subsequently reduces inappropriate billing, safeguards against fraud, and helps with future audits. Along with achieving regulatory compliance, your home health agency also sees improved home visit oversight, faster payments due to eliminated paperwork, and better scheduling and communication.\nManage Patient Medications During Home Visits\nA meticulous medication management system helps a home health agency manage medication safely, cost-effectively, and competently to achieve the best outcomes for both the home health agency and its patients. With the integration of Home Health and Medication Management, clinicians can easily monitor a patient’s medication regimen, identify actual or potential medication-related errors, and give guidance to optimize medication usage during home visits.\nManage Patient’s Care Plans During Home Visits\nHome Health’s integration with Integrated Care Management helps you to orchestrate care for your patients efficiently and holistically. Provide personalized care and enhanced outcomes by addressing each patient’s unique needs, based on their health concerns and list of medications.\nHome Health Portal for Patients\nAs a patient, take control of your healthcare journey with Home Health. With a streamlined communication with the home health agency, you can efficiently monitor your home visits and achieve an enhanced and personalized healthcare experience.\nArtificial Intelligence for Home Health\nUse details of the recommended care professionals to swiftly schedule appointments with the most appropriate care professionals.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
