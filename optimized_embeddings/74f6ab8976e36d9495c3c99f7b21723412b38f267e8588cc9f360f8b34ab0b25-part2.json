You can use any enablement site or Trailhead content you like. You also can include custom steps, such as in-person activities, or links to videos and other online content.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER ROLES\nThis topic supports these enablement site roles:\t\nContent Creators\nLearners\nExample Use Cases for Trailmixes\nCreate a trailmix when you want to design a learning journey specific to your company, your team, or your own interests. You can build a trailmix with content to tackle yourself or create one as a shared learning journey that others can follow. You can add content to the trailmix from your enablement site, Trailhead, or a combination of the two.\nDifferences Between Trailmixes and Trails\nA trailmix and trail offer similar experiences for learners in that both content types organize content in a linear journey for learners to progress through. But there are some important differences in how these content types are created and used.\nHow Learners Experience a Trailmix\nA learner can use the Trailmixes index page on your enablement site to view trailmixes that they’ve created or that a manager has assigned to them from the Trail Tracker app. A learner can also search for trailmixes, follow a trailmix, and share a trailmix.\nCreate a Trailmix\nContribute to the learning experience by creating a trailmix. Each enablement site user can create up to 1,000 trailmixes.\nEdit a Trailmix\nYou can edit a trailmix that you created—you can add content, delete content, and rearrange the content within the trailmix. You also can delete a trailmix that you created. You can’t modify trailmixes created by other people.\nAdd a Task or External Content to a Trailmix\nIn a trailmix, you can include content from outside of your enablement site and Trailhead. For example, you can include an activity that’s on the web, such as watching a video or reading an article. Or you can add a task for the user to complete, such as talking to a colleague.\nMake a Trailmix Public or Private\nWhen a user creates a trailmix, it’s private by default, and only the user that created the trailmix can see it. The user can make a trailmix public and share it with other learners on the enablement site, or make a trailmix that they previously shared private again.\nTest Trailmix Assignments with the Trail Tracker App in a Sandbox\nYou can test assigning and unassigning trailmixes with the Trail Tracker app in a sandbox.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
