Monitor the status of Apex jobs to mitigate potential limit problems before they happen.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Developer, and Database.com Editions\n\nThe Apex job queue lists Apex jobs that have been submitted for execution in the past seven days. If you want to see Apex jobs older than seven days, use the All Scheduled Jobs page for scheduled jobs or access them programmatically via AsyncApexJob. Jobs that have completed execution are listed, as well as jobs that aren’t yet finished, including:\n\nApex methods with the future annotation that haven’t yet been executed. Such jobs are listed as Future in the Job Type column, and don’t have values in the Total Batches or Batches Processed columns.\nApex classes that implement the Queueable interface that haven’t yet been executed. Such jobs are listed as Future in the Job Type column, and don’t have values in the Total Batches or Batches Processed columns.\nScheduled Apex jobs that haven’t yet finished executing.\nSuch jobs are listed as Scheduled Apex in the Job Type column, don’t have values in the Total Batches or Batches Processed columns, and always have a Queued status.\nScheduled jobs can’t be aborted from this page; use the All Scheduled Jobs page to manage or delete scheduled jobs.\nEven though a scheduled job appears on both the Apex Jobs and All Scheduled Jobs pages, it counts only one time against the asynchronous Apex execution limit.\nApex sharing recalculation batch jobs that haven’t yet finished execution. Such jobs are listed as Sharing Recalculation in the Job Type column. The records in a sharing recalculation job are automatically split into batches. The Total Batches column lists the total number of batches for the job. The Batches Processed column lists the number of batches that have already been processed.\nBatch Apex jobs that haven’t yet finished execution. Such jobs are listed as Batch Apex in the Job Type column. The records in a batch Apex job are automatically split into batches. The Total Batches column lists the total number of batches for the job. The Batches Processed column lists the number of batches that have already been processed.\nNOTE Sharing recalculation batch jobs are currently available through a limited release program. For information on enabling Apex sharing recalculation batch jobs for your organization, contact Salesforce.\n\nThis table lists all the possible job status values. The Status column lists the status of the job. The possible values are:\n\nSTATUS\tDESCRIPTION\nQueued\tThe job is awaiting execution.\nPreparing\tThe start method of the job has been invoked. This status can last a few minutes depending on the size of the batch of records.\nProcessing\tThe job is being processed.\nAborted\tThe job was aborted by a user.\nCompleted\tThe job completed with or without failure.\nFailed\tThe job experienced a system failure.\n\nBatch Apex jobs can also have a status of Holding when held in the Apex flex queue. See Monitoring the Apex Flex Queue.\n\nIf one or more errors occur during batch processing, the Status Details column gives a short description of the first error. A more detailed description of that error, along with any subsequent errors, is emailed to the last user who modified the batch class.\n\nOn the Apex Jobs page, the number in the Total Batches column can be incorrect when a large batch job is processing. To see all Apex batch classes and an accurate count of batch jobs, click the link at the top of the page to go to the batch jobs page. Click More Info on a particular batch class to show the parent jobs of the batch class, including information about:\n\nStatus\nSubmitted and completion dates\nElapsed time for each batch\nNumber of processed batches\nNumber of failed batches\n\nTo show a filtered list of items, select a predefined list from the View dropdown list, or click Create New View to define your own custom views. Filtered views are especially useful if you want to view only future methods.\n\nOnly one batch Apex job's start method can run at a time in an org. Batch jobs that haven't started yet remain in the queue until they're started. This limit doesn’t cause any batch job to fail and execute methods of batch Apex jobs still run in parallel if more than one job is running.\n\nFor any type of Apex job, you can click Abort Job in the Action column to stop all processing for that job.\n\nAll batch jobs that have completed execution are removed from the batch queue list seven days after completion.\n\nFor more information about Apex, see the Lightning Platform Apex Code Developer's Guide.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSchedule Apex Jobs\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
