Also, track ad hoc disbursements that include disbursements for recipients who received a benefit without enrolling for it, and also for recipients who availed a benefit that doesn't have a schedule or session associated with it.\n\nNOTE Salesforce offers Nonprofit Cloud, which includes integrated platform solutions for Fundraising, Program Management, Case Management, and Grantmaking. This content provides information about these solutions. Find the managed package documentation in Salesforce for Nonprofits. If you’re not sure which version your organization uses, check with your Salesforce admin.\n\nAttendance helps you evaluate the effectiveness of a benefit session. You can analyze the attendance for a session to determine the participants’ engagement, identify trends, and adjust upcoming sessions, and consider changes for similar benefits.\n\nBenefit assignment and benefit disbursement records are created for every participant that you add to a benefit schedule or a benefit session. For schedule participants, benefit schedule assignment records are also created. Any changes to a participant's disbursed quantity and attendance status are updated in their corresponding benefit disbursement records.\n\nTrack Attendance and Disbursements for Benefit Participants\nTrack attendance and disbursed benefit quantities for participants in a benefit session.\nAd Hoc Benefit Disbursement Tracking\nYou can track ad hoc disbursements for recipients who didn't enroll for a benefit before availing it. For example, people who walk in to a mental health awareness talk. You can also track disbursements for recipients of benefits without a schedule or session. For example, people from a flood-affected area who receive emergency help kits as part of a one-time kit distribution benefit.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
