The power of Lightning means you can create a user experience that improves workflow and productivity, makes jobs easier and more intuitive, even transforms your business. When you understand your options, you’re well set to design a thoughtful transition that reevaluates existing customizations and eliminates old problems. And you’re armed with the data to make a compelling case to your leadership and other decision makers.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nLoads of resources in Trailhead and Salesforce Help give you the 411 on the opportunities waiting for you with Lightning Experience and the Lightning Platform. For now, let’s look at some key features that are available only in Lightning Experience. They’re sure to answer your users’ question: what’s in it for me?\n\nFEATURE\tWHY IT’S COOL\nHome\tStart the day on the new, intelligent home page. Monitor performance to goal, and get news on key accounts. See exactly what needs doing in the Assistant.\nGrouped Record View\tDrive the right behaviors at every stage of your sales process with Grouped view for record pages. Reps work their deals more efficiently with opportunities that promote the right action at the right time. Accounts and contacts drive customer insights, easy access to details, and clean data with field-level duplicate matching.\nPath\tGuide reps through the steps of a process, such as working an opportunity from a fresh lead to closing a deal. At each step, help your team succeed with specific guidance and resources. And celebrate key milestones by tossing some virtual confetti when reps reach a designated Path stage.\nActivity Timeline\tSee open tasks, planned meetings, and accomplishments in the activity timeline on activity-enabled objects. Quickly log calls, create tasks, send emails, and more from the handy composer.\nKanban\tVisually review the status of records for most objects. Drag records from one column to another. For opportunities, get alerts when an action is needed on a key deal.\nEnhanced Notes\tTake better notes with auto-save, rich text capabilities, inline images, and versioning. Relate a note to multiple records and share notes with teammates or Chatter groups.\nEmail\tSend email through Office 365 or Gmail accounts with your Salesforce email. And see the email messages you’ve sent in your Office 365 or Gmail Sent Items folder for flawless integration.\nCollaborative Forecasts\tManage forecast types and sales quotas in Setup. Enable territory forecasts, product and schedule date forecasts, and custom measure (currency and number) forecasts. Forecast managers can share their forecasts with any Salesforce user at their company. In the opportunity list, forecast users can wrap text and use quick filters to update opportunities. And for all forecast types, users can hide rows that contain only zeros.\nSalesforce Meetings\tEffortlessly align with colleagues before sales meetings, and engage prospects and customers like never before. When sales reps glance at their scheduled events, reps see relevant, Salesforce-logged details about their event attendees—even external ones. During virtual meetings, sales teams can capture their audience with a unique camera and presentation view.\nComposer Windows\tBreeze through those minor but important activities that inevitably crop up during the day without switching context. Quickly log calls, create tasks and events, and jot down notes, all from windows that open on the current page.\nFile Preview Player\tEnjoy a richer file preview experience that doesn’t require Adobe Flash Player. Vector-based preview images render in higher quality and don’t degrade on high-resolution screens, plus they load faster. Scroll through multi-page documents, preview animated GIFs, give full-screen presentations, and access file actions.\nLive Feeds\tSee live posts in group feeds and live comments in all feeds without refreshing the page. See who’s commenting while they’re typing.\nStreams\tEasily track related information in one place by combining up to 25 feeds into one super-feed—called a stream. Create up to 100 streams.\nPost Pinning\tHighlight high-impact posts that otherwise get buried in a busy feed by pinning them to the top of group and topics feeds.\nDraft Posts\tNow those long, thoughtful posts are automatically saved as drafts to the My Drafts feed every seven seconds. Review, edit, post, or delete drafts.\nRecord Linking\tEasily link to recently viewed records, right from your post. Start with a forward slash (/), and begin entering the record name. A selection list shows your recently viewed records. Choose one to add a link to it to your post. Before you can link to records from a post or comment, your Administrator must contact Salesforce Support. Ask Salesforce to enable and set up the Quill editor for composing Rich Text content in Chatter.\nReports and Dashboards\tGet more from your data. The report run page is easy to read and filter. Animated, interactive charts bring your company’s data to life. And a new dashboard editor supports flexible layouts and components that span columns and rows.\nFavorites\tCreate shortcuts to frequently accessed pages, including records, lists, and groups.\nSearch\tFind the right records faster and act on search results with AI-powered Einstein Search. Also, benefit from improved global search and lookup search. Search results include instant results, top results, and recent records.\nLightning Apps\tEasily switch between collections of related objects, Visualforce and Lightning pages, and utilities such as Sales Dialer. Rally teams around your brand and important initiatives with custom logos and colors for each app.\nLightning Console Apps\tNavigate and work more productively with optimized workflows and a three-column layout. View and edit multiple records at the same time and quickly access utilities such as Sales Dialer and Open CTI.\nSalesforce Mobile App\tUnlock a new level of productivity, personalization, and speed for every mobile user. The new Salesforce Mobile app delivers a consistent experience between desktop and mobile, with access to the same data and the same customizations.\nFlow Builder\tGuide users through multi-step processes and associate flows with records using Salesforce automation tools.\nSetup Tree and Object Manager\tNavigate setup pages with a simplified organization and a cleaner look and feel. Use the Object Manager, which combines all standard and custom objects into a single list that’s easier to search.\nLightning App Builder\tCreate custom pages for Lightning Experience and the Salesforce Mobile app with clicks instead of code. Define columns and tabs and position Lightning components exactly where you want them. Use filters to control when components appear.\nService Setup Flows\tGet up and running quickly with Lightning Service Console using service-specific setup flows. These flows walk you through setting up Email-to-Case, integrating with Twitter and Facebook, creating an Experience Builder site, and enabling Lightning Knowledge, Omni-Channel, and Chat.\nSales Dialer\tUse phone features without ever leaving Salesforce. Make and receive calls, add call notes, and log call information with ease. Available for an extra cost.\nSalesforce Einstein\tSupercharge the productivity of your sales, service, and marketing teams with AI. Using key predictions, intelligent recommendations, and timely automation, everyone can work smarter and faster. Some Einstein features are available for an extra cost.\nSales Engagement\tAccelerate your inside sales process with a high-productivity workspace. Sales managers can create custom sales processes that guide sales reps through handling prospects. Reps can access productivity-boosting features like the Work Queue, email templates, call scripts, and more. Plus, you can track how prospects respond to the handling you customize. Sales Engagement gives your sales teams everything necessary for handling prospects in a fraction of the time it took before. Available for an extra cost.\nSEE ALSO\nVideo: Let's Take Lightning Experience for a Spin\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
