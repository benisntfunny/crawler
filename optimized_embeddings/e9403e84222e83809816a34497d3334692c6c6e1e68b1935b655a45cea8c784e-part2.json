When you set up Einstein Opportunity Scoring, you choose whether to have Einstein consider all opportunity records and opportunity fields or only a subset. If Einstein Opportunity Scoring is on by default, make sure that scores appear where you want, such as your customized opportunity page layouts and public list views.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic.\nAvailable with Sales Cloud Einstein, which is available in Performance and Unlimited Editions, and for an extra cost in Enterprise Edition\nAvailable to eligible customers for no extra cost in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo set up Einstein Opportunity Scoring:\tCustomize Application AND Modify All Data AND View All Profiles\nNOTE If you use Sales Cloud Einstein features without any Sales Cloud Einstein add-on licenses, and it’s your first time setting up Einstein Opportunity Scoring, see Set Up Einstein Opportunity Scoring for Sales Cloud Users.\nTo open the Einstein Opportunity Scoring setup page, do one of the following.\nIn Lightning Experience, from Setup, enter Assisted Setup in the Quick Find box, and then select Assisted Setup. Then, click Set Up next to Einstein Opportunity Scoring.\nIn Salesforce Classic, from Setup, enter Einstein Opportunity Scoring in the Quick Find box, and then select Einstein Opportunity Scoring.\nRead the introduction, and then click Next.\nChoose whether to have Einstein consider all opportunity records or only a subset when building the scoring model. Then, click Next. If needed, define the conditions, and click Next.\nWhen you give Einstein only a subset of opportunities to look at, it can yield more accurate scores. For example, if you use external systems to create opportunities that are closed rather quickly, those opportunities don’t reflect the normal opportunity lifecycle and can skew your scores.\n\nWhen defining conditions, you can use up to 100 fields. The CurrencyIsoCode field isn’t available. The following field data types aren’t supported.\n\nAddress\nDate\nDatetime\nDouble\nEncrypted String\nGeolocation\nMultipicklist\nReference (However, the RecordTypeId reference field is supported.)\nText Area\nText Area\nTime\nChoose whether to have Einstein consider all opportunity custom fields when building the scoring model. Then, click Next. If needed, deselect the fields you want Einstein to exclude, and click Next.\nExclude fields from the model only if you’re sure they aren’t part of the opportunity lifecycle. For example, you can safely exclude automatically generated fields, such as IDs and dates. Mistakenly excluding influential fields makes opportunity scores less accurate. If you’re unsure about whether to exclude a certain field, err on the side of caution and include the field.\nReview your settings. Then, click Start to begin the scoring process.\n\nIt can take up to 48 hours to analyze your data, build a scoring model, and add scores to opportunities. To check the status, return to the Einstein Opportunity Scoring setup page. If you don’t have enough opportunity data to build your own predictive model, Einstein uses a global model. The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough opportunity data, Einstein builds a scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\n\nMake sure that the Opportunity Score field is on your opportunity page layouts.\nIn Lightning Experience (Grouped view), add the Opportunity Score field to your customized opportunity page layouts. Salesforce automatically adds this field to default compact layouts.\nIn Lightning Experience (Full view), Salesforce automatically adds the Opportunity Score field to the Details section of your default and custom layouts.\nIn Salesforce Classic, add the Opportunity Score field to your customized page layouts for opportunities. Salesforce automatically adds this field to the Details section of default page layouts.\nBy default, the Opportunity Score field is on the Recently Viewed list view for opportunities, but add it to public opportunity list views. To get the most out of Einstein Opportunity Scoring, ask your sales teams to add this field to their own opportunity list views.\nIf you use Collaborative Forecasts, add the Opportunity Score field to the opportunity list on the forecasts page.\nAdd the Opportunity Score field to your opportunity reports where appropriate.\nSEE ALSO\nSelect Who Can Use Sales Cloud Einstein\nEinstein Opportunity Scoring\nConsiderations for Setting Up Einstein Opportunity Scoring\nUnderstand How Einstein Scores Your Opportunities\nCreate Custom Report Types for Einstein Opportunity Scoring\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
