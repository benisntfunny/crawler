The preconfigured campaign flow includes only email messages, but you can add SMS messages to any segment-triggered flow if you have the paid SMS add-on.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\nSingle Email Campaign Flows\n\nWhen you’re sending a single email, you configure everything from the campaign record. Before you can activate the campaign flow, you must select an audience segment, edit and publish your email content, and set a schedule for sending.\n\nIf you don’t want to schedule your email for the future, use the Send Now option in the Schedule section. This option immediately activates the campaign flow and queues your email to send. To schedule or send the email, activate the campaign flow from the campaign record or in Flow Builder.\n\nTo add a message, click and open the campaign flow.\n\nMessage Series Campaign Flows\n\nWhen you’re creating a series of emails, you can select a segment (1) and edit each email from the campaign record. To schedule messages and activate your campaign flow, open Flow Builder. The related campaign flow comes with two emails that you can customize to meet your needs (2).\n\nRefreshing Segment Data\n\nSegment membership is updated according to the segment’s publish schedule. When you activate a campaign flow, you have the option to use the segment’s publish schedule, or to republish the segment immediately before the campaign flow runs. These options are also accessible in Flow Builder when you configure the segment on the Start element.\n\nTo help ensure you’re using the most up-to-date segment data, select the option to republish your segment immediately before the flow runs.\n\nDeactivating Message Campaigns\n\nTo deactivate a message series, open the campaign flow in Flow Builder, and then click Deactivate in the button bar. For single email campaigns, deactivate from the campaign record.\n\nWhen you deactivate a campaign flow for a single email from the campaign record, the flow completes and sends any remaining messages. When you deactivate a recurring campaign flow, the flow finishes the current run and doesn’t repeat.\n\nTo deactivate and stop all future scheduled emails from sending, edit the campaign flow in Flow Builder, and then use the deactivate and cancel option.\n\nUsing SMS Messages in Campaigns\n\nYou can add SMS messages to any segment-triggered flow. First, create an SMS message on the Content tab. Then, add it to the flow for an existing campaign. If you don’t need emails in your flow, you can delete the email elements.\n\nSEE ALSO\nPublish a Segment in Data Cloud\nCreate an Email in Marketing Cloud Growth\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
