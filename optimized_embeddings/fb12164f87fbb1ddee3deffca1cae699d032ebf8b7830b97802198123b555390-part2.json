The permission sets also include some CRM Analytics features, such as dashboards and the ability to analyze your report data using Einstein Discovery for Reports. Assign a permission set to users.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\nAvailable with Sales Cloud Einstein, which is available in Performance and Unlimited Editions, and for an extra cost in Enterprise Edition\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo create permission sets:\tManage Profiles and Permission Sets\nTo assign permission sets:\tAssign Permission Sets\nFrom Setup, enter Permission Sets in the Quick Find. Then, select Permission Sets.\nClick the permission set you want to assign.\nIn Performance and Unlimited editions, assign the Sales Cloud Einstein Included or Sales Cloud Included Bundle to users.\n\nTo access Sales Cloud Einstein using Performance or Unlimited editions, users must also have the Salesforce standard user license.\n\nIf you have users who accessed Sales Cloud Einstein through the Sales Cloud Einstein, Inbox, Sales Engagement, or Revenue Intelligence license before Summer ’22, we recommend that you assign those users to the Sales Cloud Einstein Included or Sales Cloud Included permission set, or a custom permission set that includes the Sales Cloud Einstein permission. To make these assignments, assign the new permission set to your users before removing the old permission set. Beginning in Summer ‘22, you can’t add users to the old Sales Cloud Einstein, Inbox, Sales Engagement, or Revenue Intelligence permission sets.\n\nIn Enterprise Edition, assign the Sales Cloud Einstein permission set to users.\nTo assign the permission set to users, click Manage Assignments\nNOTE\nThe standard Sales Cloud Einstein Included and Sales Cloud Included Bundle permission sets include the permissions for most Sales Cloud Einstein features, plus access to dashboards. Account Insights and Opportunity Insights aren’t included with Sales Cloud Einstein in Unlimited and Performance editions. Most permissions are enabled by default. To modify a permission set, clone it and edit the app permissions.\nThe standard Sales Cloud Einstein Included, Sales Cloud Einstein Included Bundle, and Sales Cloud Einstein permission sets include the CRM Analytics permission Can Run Einstein Discovery for Reports. After Can Run Einstein Discovery for Reports is assigned, you must enable CRM Analytics. Then users then get access to the Analyze button on reports, which lets users run statistical analysis on their report data.\nThe View Opportunity Scoring Model Factors permission, which lets users see the factors that are used to build opportunity scoring models, isn’t enabled by default. Clone the Sales Cloud Einstein Included or Sales Cloud Included Bundle permission set. Then, enable the View Opportunity Scoring Model Factors permission and assign the permission set to users. Users who can view model factors can sometimes see the object data and object-related data used to build the models, regardless of their sharing settings.\nThe Sales Analytics app also comes with Sales Cloud Einstein but isn’t included in the Sales Cloud Einstein Included or Sales Cloud Included Bundle permission set. You must set up permissions for the Sales Analytics App separately.\nIf you used Sales Cloud Einstein before Spring ’18, you created a permission set with the Sales Cloud Einstein permission set license. New permissions were added to the permission set license in later releases. Make sure the permissions for all the Einstein features that you want to use, including analytics, are enabled in your permission set license.\nSEE ALSO\nSet Up Permissions for the Sales Analytics\nSet Up Sales Cloud Einstein\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
