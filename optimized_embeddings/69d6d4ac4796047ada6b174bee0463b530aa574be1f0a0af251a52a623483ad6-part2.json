Create user profiles and assign the required permission sets to user groups. Customize page layouts to give your users a streamlined view of all vehicles, customers, and stakeholders. Configure vehicle inventory search, appointment scheduling, and the service console. Collaborate with partners and customers with extensible Experience Cloud portals. Set up additional tools, components, and Analytics to scale up and enhance your business.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\nEnable Features for Automotive Cloud\nTurn on settings in your org that enable Automotive Cloud and its associated features.\nPermission Set Licenses for Automotive Cloud\nAutomotive Cloud users need permission set licenses to interact with settings, workflows, and features. See which permission set licenses apply to different groups of users. Understand what each permission set license offers. All core app users need the Automotive Foundation User permission set license at a minimum. Depending on the user role, determine which other permission set licenses to assign to users. To collaborate with external users, you also need the Experience Cloud permission set licenses.\nExperience Cloud Permission Set Licenses for Automotive\nGive your partners and customers access to Automotive Cloud features with Experience Cloud sites. When you create an Experience Cloud site, you decide which features your customers or partners need access to. For example, you can provide dealers the ability to manage vehicles and track leads, but you don’t want to give them the ability to create and manage visits. Or, you want your customers to only view their household information and schedule vehicle service appointments.\nSet Up Users and Permissions for Automotive Cloud\nLearn about the provided permission set licenses for Automotive Cloud. Create user profiles and user records, then assign permission sets to users.\nConfigure and Customize Page Layouts for Automotive Cloud\nGet the most out of Automotive Cloud with customized page layouts for Vehicle, Account, Lead, Opportunity and more.

Create customized page layouts that help district managers and evaluation officers successfully carry out visits and audit tasks at dealer locations.\nSet Up Experience Cloud Sites for Automotive\nCollaborate with partners and customers using Experience Cloud for Automotive. Create partner or customer user profiles and users, use the Automotive template to create a site, and customize the site to show relevant information to external users. You can also control access on the objects and records that you share with external users. To plan your implementation, review the required user licenses and permission set licenses.\nSet Up Data Cloud for Automotive Cloud\nSet up Data Cloud for your automotive business and configure settings that help users work with the Automotive data kit.\nSet Up the Service Console for Automotive Cloud\nCustomer service representatives can use Service Console for Automotive to get a holistic picture of customers and their activities, effectively address customer requests, and earn their trust. Refine each step of the service journey to perfection with Service Excellence components: Identity Verification, Timeline, Record Alerts, Action Launcher, and Audit Trail.\nSet Up Appointment Scheduling in Automotive Cloud\nSet up Salesforce Scheduler features in Automotive Cloud and use the predefined OmniScript-based scheduling flows to help users create test drive and vehicle service appointments. Territory managers can create service territories, work types and work type groups, service resources, and vehicles and assets that are used in the appointment scheduling flows. You can also customize the predefined OmniStudio components available in Automotive Cloud so that the appointment scheduling flows meet your business requirements.\nSet Up Vehicle Inventory Search in Automotive Cloud\nSet up Criteria-Based Search and Filter features in Automotive Cloud to help users search and filter vehicle inventory data. Design your own search experience by using the Vehicle Searchable Field object that combines fields from multiple objects to create a searchable inventory data set. Decide which fields to use as query criteria, which fields to use for result display, and which fields to use to sort and aggregate the results. Users can quickly view the inventory at each location and based on the results, they can transfer vehicles to the desired location to meet customer demands. Or, create a search configuration based on the Vehicle object directly so that users can quickly search for relevant Vehicle records.\nSet Up Captive Finance in Automotive Cloud\nConfigure settings that allow your service representatives to effectively use the Finance Console for Automotive app. Create actionable relationship center graphs from templates and add them to the Account and Financial Account pages.

Some features are configured in Setup, others in the app, and some require integration with external systems. Make the most of features like Events and Milestones, Timeline, Actionable Relationship Center, Interest Tags, Relationship Cards, and Record Alerts to enhance your automotive business. Implement the features you need based on your business requirements.\nDeploy Analytics for Automotive App\nThe Analytics for Automotive app provides the dealers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) insights to track and monitor their dealership-based automotive business. Use the data-driven dashboards to get a detailed overview of the dealer's performance, sales lifecycle, revenue trends, and aging inventory.\nCommon Components Supported in Automotive Cloud\nUse the Lightning App Builder to add components to record pages in Automotive Cloud. Use the Experience Cloud Builder to add components to pages after you create an Experience Cloud site using the Automotive template. Review the list of components supported for internal and external users.\nPrebuilt Apps for Automotive Cloud\nImplement custom business use cases by using the prebuilt apps for Automotive Cloud. Prebuilt apps include metadata, tools, and workflows for nuanced, process-specific needs. Explore the prebuilt apps in the Automotive Cloud learning trial org. You can also deploy and use the prebuilt apps in your sandbox or production org.\nOmniStudio for Automotive Cloud\nOmniStudio is a managed package of application components built on the Salesforce platform that you can download and install into Automotive Cloud.
