Preview elements in steps, customize properties, and access contextual guidance to discover and learn about functionality while creating your script.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Professional, and Unlimited Editions with Financial Services Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Health Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Education Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Nonprofit Cloud\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with Public Sector Solutions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo build the layout of a form:\t\n\nFinancial Services Cloud Extension AND OmniStudio Admin AND OmniStudio Runtime permission sets\n\nFor Public Sector Solutions, only OmniStudio Admin is required\n\nFrom the App Launcher, search for OmniScripts, and then select OmniScripts.\nChange the list view to All OmniScripts.\nSelect an existing OmniScript.\nThis operation opens the selected OmniScript in the OmniScript Designer on a new tab. In the Header, you can view high-level metadata about the OmniScript such as Type, SubType, Version, Language, and Activation status.\nTo add more questions to the form, at the upper-right corner of the form, click Edit Form.\nNOTE While building the layout of the form, if some questions in the OmniScript are no longer in the active version, click Edit Form at the upper-right corner and then click OK. This operation refreshes the OmniScript with the latest active question versions.\nFrom the Navigation panel, access and navigate between active and inactive actions, steps, and step elements.\nTo preview and configure elements, on the canvas, expand the steps.\nTo build your scripts, drag the action, display, function, group, and input elements, and entire OmniScripts from the Build panel onto the canvas.\nEnhance the form by dragging the required elements from the palette onto the form.\nIn the Properties panel, either configure the properties for action, display, function, group, input, and embeddable OmniScript elements in the UI or edit the properties as JSON values.\nIn the Setup panel, configure optional script-wide settings.\nNOTE For Discovery Framework OmniScripts, usageType is a reserved keyword. You cannot use usageType as a key value in OmniScript Data JSON. For example, you can’ use usageType in Assessment Question names, Data Raptor outputs, and so on.\nUse Data from Previously Submitted Responses\nSave your respondents the time and effort of entering responses to the same questions on different assessment forms. By adding the prefill integration procedure to an OmniScript, the form can access data from previously submitted assessments. Customize the prefill integration procedure to suit your needs.\nDesignate Questions to Prefill with Previously Submitted Responses\nSave your respondents the time and effort of entering responses to specific questions more than one time. Collect new responses for certain questions on assessment forms, and prefill other questions with data retrieved from previous assessment responses. To access data from previously submitted responses, activate the prefill assessment question decision table and the prefill with decision table integration procedure. Then set up OmniScripts to determine whether to prefill questions.\nAdd a QR Code to an Assessment Form\nInclude a QR code on a form to let respondents open the URL or application from their mobile device. For example, respondents can scan the QR code to open a third-party application and upload documents for identity verification and screening.\nCapture a Respondent’s Signature on the Form\nRespondents can use a digital signature to authenticate their responses on the form when you add the Discovery Framework Signature element to a form. They can either type or draw their name or initials, and use the signature in multiple places on the form before submitting it. The Assessment Signature object stores the signature details, and the Digital Signature object stores the signature.\nDynamically Identify the Documents to Upload for an Assessment\nUse the Document Matrix element in Discovery Framework–based OmniScripts to streamline the assessment process and ensure that respondents upload the correct documents.\nSave Assessments as Drafts in Health Cloud\nInternal Health Cloud users can save drafts of the assessments that they’re not ready to submit. They can easily find the draft assessments that are in progress and complete them at their convenience later. The flexibility to save drafts prevents loss of work when internal users pause an assessment for any reason.\nSEE ALSO\nOmniStudio Foundation: OmniScript Designer Overview\nConsiderations for Working with Discovery Framework\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
