The way you access Chatter feeds, groups, and profiles is a bit different in the new interface. But with this quick overview, we hope you feel right at home.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Developer, and Contact Manager Editions\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, you typically access Chatter features from the sidebar on the Chatter tab. In Lightning Experience, access Chatter, colleagues’ profiles (People), and groups from the App Launcher. You can also get to these places from a tab or the overflow menu, depending on what’s showing.\n\nTo collaborate on records, look for the Chatter tab on the record. You can post updates, create polls, ask questions, and share files, just like in Salesforce Classic.\n\nWork with Chatter Feeds\n\nDifferent feeds on the Chatter tab let you show a select subset of posts (1). Like Salesforce Classic, use the tabs on the left side of the Chatter tab to change your feed view in Lightning Experience. Typically, the What I Follow feed is the default feed. If you’re following fewer than 10 things, though, the Company Highlights feed becomes your default. Company Highlights shows you the most active posts across your organization. You can use it to find more things to follow. After you follow more than 10, your default feed changes to What I Follow.\n\nFeed filters let you narrow your feed view even further. The type of feed you’re visiting determines the filters that you see on the list.\n\nFeeds in Lightning Experience include many of the options that are available in Salesforce Classic and some that aren’t.\n\nThe Post, Poll, and Question actions are available in the publisher on the Chatter tab. To access buttons for uploading a file,mentioning people, adding a hyperlink, or linking to a record, click the publisher’s text box. Other standard Chatter actions that appear in the publisher in Salesforce Classic, like Thanks, aren’t available in Lightning Experience.\nNOTE In Lightning Experience, you can use a post to convey thanks. The inline image feature lets you include your own branded thank-you image to go along with it.\nYou can add an active link in Lightning Experience in the rich text editor. Enter the URL, and your link becomes active when you share the post. You can also add a hyperlink by highlighting text in your post, clicking the Link icon, and adding your URL. Link to a record by entering a forward slash (/), and then the record name. This action opens a selection list of matching records.\nNOTE Listed records are returned as the result of a search, and search returns only recently viewed records. So, only the records you interacted with recently appear on the list.\nSort the feed by most recent posts or comments. Lightning Experience offers a wider variety of filter options than you see in Salesforce Classic. Available options depend on the type of feed that you’re in. For example, group feeds give you filtering options for different views of questions. Question filters let group experts quickly find questions that are still open and group members easily find the questions with a selected best answer.\n\nIn a profile feed, you can select a filter that shows only the profiled user’s posts.\n\nTo see up-to-date information, refresh the feed using the Refresh icon that’s next to the Filter icon. This Refresh icon refreshes just the feed, so the entire page doesn’t require a reload. Group feeds in Lightning Experience are live and don’t usually require a manual refresh. Comments are live everywhere, not just in groups. And, when people are actively commenting, you can see an animation and the names of the people who are commenting.\nLocate information in a specific feed with feed search. In Lightning Experience, feed global search results provide the Top Post filtering option for narrowing results to what’s most relevant to you.\nAdd topic tags to posts in both interfaces.\nLightning Experience saves your draft posts seven seconds after you start entering them. You can see your drafts in the My Drafts feed. Go to My Drafts to review, edit. post, or delete your drafts. Posts are saved as drafts, but questions and polls aren’t.\nTIP For accessibility, every feed has a hidden Skip Feed link that you get to by tabbing. Skip Feed skips you past the feed to the End Feed tag. From End Feed, you can tab into the column that typically shows features like Einstein Recommendations and Trending Topics. Whether a Chatter publisher is present, the Skip Feed link follows the tab succession, Sort by, Search, Filter (if present), Refresh this feed, then Skip Feed.\nSEE ALSO\nFeed Sort and Filter Options\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
