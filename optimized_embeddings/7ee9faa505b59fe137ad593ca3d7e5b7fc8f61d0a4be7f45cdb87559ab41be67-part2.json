We give you examples of common requests and things to consider. That way, you can determine a plan of action for complying with the regulations that apply to you.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: All Editions\n\nMany data protection and privacy regulations can require you to delete shoppers’ personal data when customers request it, or when it’s no longer necessary to keep. We’ve listed a few of the regulations that are important to many companies collecting and processing their customers’ data.\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European Union\nPersonal Information Protection Act (PIPA), Japan\nPrivacy Act, Australia\nPersonal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), Canada\n\nIf you have shoppers who want the data that you've collected on them deleted, or to opt-out of certain types of data sharing, review these common requests and the procedures related to them.\n\nCOMMON SHOPPER REQUEST\tACTIONS TO CONSIDER\tTHINGS TO CONSIDER\nI want you to delete my data from the system after my account is deleted.\tDelete all data associated with the customer, as shown in this table.\t\n\nWhen you delete a customer, you delete certain associated data. See Deleting Customers.\n\nAll other data deletion requires extra steps, as noted in this table.\n\nSee Browser-Based Local Data Storage to consider whether to inform the shopper of any browser cookies that exist on their computer.\n\n\nI want you to delete my order history.\tDelete an order\tSet up automatic order removal after a set number of days using the Order Retention setting. The shopper may need to keep certain data to fulfill their obligations under tax and other laws.\nI want you to delete any guest baskets I create.\tSet basket lifetime for unregistered guests\tThe system deletes guest baskets after 240 minutes by default.\nI want you to delete any custom object containing my personal data.\tDelete Custom Objects\tThe merchant creates and maintains custom objects that can contain personal data. Verify this using the Custom Object Editor in Business Manager.\nI want you to delete my personal information from all gift certificates.\tRemove customer data from gift certificates\tGift Certificates contain the email of a recipient. Either remove the recipient's email or delete the entire Gift Certificate. If you delete the entire Gift Certificate, consider how you will refund the remaining balance.\nI want you to delete my personal information from redeemed coupons.\tDelete email addresses from redeemed coupons\tRemove email addresses from redeemed coupons using the Forget Email feature.\nI want you to delete any lingering cookies or data objects.\tInstruct customers to delete cookies and objects from their browsers.\tThe process to delete cookies and objects depends on the browser the shopper is using. Instruct shoppers to refer to the documentation for their browser.\nOne of my shoppers in California asked that we not sell her data to other companies.\tConsider if a third-party integration, built by the customer or otherwise enabled in Commerce Cloud, is within the scope of the request and how you would respond.\tCustomers should consider if they need to build customizations to pass on the request to vendors.\nI need to create a button on my e-commerce website to receive and honor consumer requests to not sell data to other companies.\tCustomers can create a button with a clear and conspicuous link on their website. It is the customer's responsibility to determine whether a button is needed. The customer and their implementation partner should build this button and any components to address actions described in our Help & Training documentation.\tCustomers should consider, through customization,  how they can track the request and their responses to them.\nI want you to delete information stored in my local browser sessions.\tBrowser-Based Local Data Storage\tCommerce Cloud uses browser cookies and session storage objects to store and track information. This information can exist on machines with browsers running Commerce Cloud merchant applications, or with browsers accessing websites that run on Commerce Cloud.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
