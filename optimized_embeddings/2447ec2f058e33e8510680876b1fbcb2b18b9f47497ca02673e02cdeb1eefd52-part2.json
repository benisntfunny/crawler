Providers use the Health Cloud provider portal to review, negotiate, and sign the contract.\n\nContracting Data Model\n\nVlocity stores contracting data using the standard Salesforce object Contract. This object is used in conjunction with the Vlocity objects Contract Line Item and Product Jurisdiction Network.\n\nNOTE A provider jurisdiction network identifies a network that provides benefits for a given plan type (such as a product) under a given jurisdiction, especially when a health plan is sold across multiple jurisdictions under different provider networks.\n\nOnce providers are contracted, they are officially in-network, and they are stored as records in these Vlocity objects:\n\nContract Provider Network — Used to track relationship between a provider and a contract specific to a network.\nProvider Network — Tracks different types of health care networks for different types of health plans (such as HMO, PPO, Medicare).\nProvider Network Member — Used to identify an organization or an individual service provider who has agreed to provide its services for an insurance company network.\nContract Document — Represents an online version of a contract document. A contract document can have physical files attached to it such as Word files or PDF files. Signed contract between the provider and the network.\n\nDepending on the release you're using, the provider contracting objects are either Vlocity objects or Health Cloud objects.\n\nIF YOU ARE USING:\n\n\t\n\nVLOCITY OBJECT\n\n\t\n\nHEALTH CLOUD OBJECT\n\n\n\n\nVlocity Health and Vlocity Insurance Summer '21 package\n\n\t \t \n\n\nContract Provider Network\n\n\t\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nProvider Network\n\n\t\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nProvider Network Member\n\n\t\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nVlocity Health and Vlocity Insurance Winter '22 package\n\n\t \t \n\n\nRetired\n\n\t\n\nHealthcare Payer Network\n\n\n\n\nRetired\n\n\t\n\nHealthcare Payer Network\n\n\n\n\nRetired\n\n\t\n\nHealthcare Facility Network\n\nFor more information, see Vlocity Objects Available in Health Cloud.\n\nFee Scheduling\n\nAn important part of contracting, fee scheduling determines how to reimburse providers once they have joined the network and started providing services to health plan members. Contract specialists use the Provider Network Management solution to create fee schedules and the associated entries. Fee schedules are the centrepiece of any contract with a provider. A contract cannot be completed or activated without an agreed fee schedule between the health plan and the provider.\n\nTIP See Fee Schedules for detailed information on how to create a fee schedule.\n\nFee schedule data is stored using the following Vlocity objects:\n\nFee Schedule — Used to define the associated published collection of fee schedules used by insurance carriers to pay its service providers and suppliers. Includes fields for fee schedule code, source (CM or carrier), and effective start and end dates.\nFee Schedule Entry — This is how you associate fees, based on specific insurance codes and jurisdictions, for a particular fee schedule. Includes fields for insurance code, the actual fee amount, and so forth. In plain English: this is the amount to be paid for a specific procedure within a specific jurisdiction.\nProvider Fee Schedule — Used to associate a provider to a fee schedule. Includes fields for base rate factor, the fee schedule code (as previously created), provider account, and effective start and end dates for the schedule.\nProvider Fee Schedule Entry — These are the specific fees for a provider, based on the associated provider fee schedule. Includes fields for provider fee schedule, rate factor, fee type (rate or fixed), insurance code, and negotiated amount. In short, these are the fees that a particular provider has negotiated for a specific procedure.\n\nAll of these objects work in tandem to build the foundation for a health plan member to enter into a contract with a provider. The contract is based on an agreed upon fee and price list that a provider will deliver to members.\n\nDepending on the release you're using, the provider fee scheduling objects are either Vlocity objects or Health Cloud objects.\n\nIF YOU ARE USING:\n\n\t\n\nVLOCITY OBJECT\n\n\t\n\nHEALTH CLOUD OBJECT\n\n\n\n\nVlocity Health and Vlocity Insurance Winter '22 package\n\n\t\n\nFee Schedule\n\n\t\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nFee Schedule Entry\n\n\t\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nProvider Fee Schedule\n\n\t\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nProvider Fee Schedule Entry\n\n\t\n\nNot Applicable\n\n\n\n\nVlocity Health and Vlocity Insurance Spring '22 package\n\n\t\n\nRetired\n\n\t\n\nFee Schedule Definition\n\n\n\n\nRetired\n\n\t\n\nCare Fee Schedule Item\n\n\n\n\nRetired\n\n\t\n\nContract Payment Agreement\n\n\n\n\nRetired\n\n\t\n\nStandard Care Fee Agreement\n\nFor more information, see Vlocity Objects Available in Health Cloud and Provider Network Management.\n\nIMPORTANT A contract cannot be completed or activated without an agreed upon fee schedule between a provider and health plan.\nFee Schedules\nA fee schedule is a comprehensive list of fees used by doctors, dentists, and other health care professionals of fee maximums used to reimburse a physician, dentist, or other providers, for a service. Procedure codes are the codes associated with specific services.\nCustomizing Fee Schedule Columns\nVlocity has created a fee schedule data table that appears when you create a new fee scheduleFee Schedules. The default table has an input column for Procedure Code and output columns for Description, Facility Price, and Non-Facility Price.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
