The list includes their access level and an explanation and shows every user who has access that’s greater than the org-wide default settings.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs)\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nNOTE Some sharing rules specify access to an object and its associated objects. For sharing rules that specify access for associated object records, the given access level applies to that sharing rule only. For example, if an account sharing rule specifies Private as the access level for associated contacts, a user can access associated contacts via other means. These means include org-wide defaults, the Modify All Data or View All Data permission, or the Modify All or View All permission for contacts.\nTo display a list of users who have access, click Sharing on the desired record.\nTo see full details about who has access to this record, click Expand List.\nTo see the reason the user has access to the record, click Why? next to a user’s name. If there are multiple reasons with different access levels, the user is always granted the most permissive access level. The possible reasons are:\nREASON\tDESCRIPTION\nAccount Guest Sharing Rule\tThe guest user has access via an account guest user sharing rule created by the administrator.\nAccount Sharing Rule\tThe user has access via an account sharing rule created by the administrator.\nAccount Sharing\tThe user was granted access via the Sharing button on the associated account.\nAccount Team\tThe user is a member of the account team.\nAccount Territory\tThe account has been assigned to a territory to which the user has access.\nAdministrator\tThe user has the “Modify All Data” or “View All Data” administrative permission, or the “Modify All” or “View All” object permission.\nAsset Guest Sharing Rule\tThe guest user has access via an asset guest user sharing rule created by the administrator.\nAsset Sharing Rule\tThe user has access via an asset sharing rule created by the administrator.\nAssociated Guest User Sharing\tThe guest user has sharing access to a record associated with the account.
