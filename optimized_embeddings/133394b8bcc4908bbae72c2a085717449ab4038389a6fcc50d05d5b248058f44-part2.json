Each price book provides pricing information for products that the Marketplace operator and seller make available in the storefront. Also, in a price book you can find price book entries that contain the price ranges associated with each product. The Default price book contains the base prices for products, which are displayed on the storefront as Price From. The Sale price book lists the sale price for the products in the Default price book. A seller can have only one Default price book and one Sale price book, but you can have multiple Customer Group price books. A Customer Group price book contains the discount prices that are presented only to customers who buy the product on a large scale.\n\nCreate a Default Price Book\nThe Default price book contains the base prices for products, which are displayed on the storefront as Price From. Usually, these prices are not the most advantageous price for marketing the product. You can have only one Default price book.\nCreate a Sale Price Book\nThe Sale price book lists the sale price for the products in the Default price book. You can have only one Sale price book.\nCreate a Customer Group Price Book\nThe Customer Group price book contains the discount prices that are presented only to customers who buy the product on a large scale.\nAdd Prices to a Price Book\nYou can add the different sale values of a product to a price book. After each price book is created, a price book entry is assigned to it. Price book entries provide a record of the sale values of a product. You can assign different prices to a product or variant if the quantity is different. For example, purchasing one unit of product yellow shirt is $10, while nine units of product yellow shirt is $7 each.\nEdit a Price Book\nFrom the Commerce Marketplace app, you can manage the price book information that sellers enter in the Seller Portal. You can also choose to share the Customer Groups you created with sellers by configuring the sharing rules during the implementation.\nConfigure Sharing Rules for Customer Groups\nIf you want to share the Customer Groups you created in the Commerce Marketplace app with sellers, configure the sharing rules during the implementation.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
