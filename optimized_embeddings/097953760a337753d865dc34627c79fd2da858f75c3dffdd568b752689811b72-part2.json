Share content by publishing to channels such as a commerce site, marketing email, customer community, partner portal, or any digital experience. Access Salesforce CMS from the Digital Experiences app.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nSo what exactly is a hybrid CMS? A hybrid CMS means that you can create content and extend it to any channel built on Salesforce. These channels can include a commerce site, a marketing email, a customer community, or a partner portal. And you can use the same content on channels outside of Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce CMS is included in a limited capacity for all Salesforce orgs. Customers with Experience Cloud licenses can access all the features included in Salesforce CMS.\n\nWatch the video to learn more about Salesforce CMS.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the key elements that make up the Digital Experiences app and Salesforce CMS.\n\nThe Digital Experiences App\n\nThe Digital Experiences app, accessed from the Lightning Experience App Launcher, is where you create and manage all things Salesforce CMS. Here you can access the Digital Experiences Home, your CMS workspaces and channels, and Experience Builder sites.\n\nCMS Workspaces\n\nYou use CMS workspaces to create and organize your content. With role-based access in CMS workspaces, you have granular control over who’s creating content and where the content is shared. Each workspace can have its own contributors, translation language settings, channels, content, and folders. So you can create separate CMS workspaces to differentiate internal and external information, different geographies, or even different campaigns.\n\nNOTE When you refresh a sandbox, the metadata updates from the source org. Since CMS content is considered data and not metadata, Salesforce CMS only supports Full sandboxes for CMS content and collections. You can’t copy CMS content as part of setup or Partial Copy sandboxes. Also, you can't deploy CMS content from one sandbox to another, or to a production environment because only metadata (settings) are deployable. Instead, export content from a CMS workspace in one environment and import content to the destination org’s CMS workspace.\nCMS Channels\n\nShare the content in your CMS workspace with one or more endpoints, or channels. The channel determines where the content from your CMS workspace is published. You can connect to any Salesforce-based channel, such as an Experience Cloud or Commerce Cloud site, Marketing Cloud email, Heroku site, or Lightning app. Or you can connect to external third-party sites using headless APIs.\n\nIn Experience Builder sites, you can also organize and tag your content and curate collections (for Aura sites), and then add content to your site pages using Builder components.\n\nDeliver content to a global audience by adding translation languages to your CMS workspaces so you can offer multilingual content in your publishing channels.\n\nEnable Access to the Digital Experiences App\nThe Digital Experiences app is where you access the Digital Experiences Home, all CMS workspaces, CMS channels, all sites, and Experience Builder.\nNavigate the Digital Experiences Home Tab\nAccess your CMS workspaces and site detail pages from the Digital Experiences Home tab. Jump to CMS channels, workspaces, and sites. View existing CMS Workspaces and All Sites, or create them from the home page. Access valuable help links to important resources without leaving the app.\nSEE ALSO\nCMS Workspaces\nRole-Based Access in Salesforce CMS\nCMS Content\nCMS Channels\nCMS Developer Guide: Connect Your External CMS to Your Experience Builder Site\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
