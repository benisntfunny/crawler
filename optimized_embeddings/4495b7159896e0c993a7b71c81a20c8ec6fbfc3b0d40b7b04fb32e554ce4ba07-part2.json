The score ranges from 0% to 100%. Higher scores represent higher confidence that the open or click is real. Lower scores represent a higher chance that the open or click event is machine-generated.\n\nThe model analyzes an individual’s historical engagement events and patterns to predict the chance that an open or click is real. The model monitors behavior changes using event association and attribution. The most recent behavior changes and engagement patterns are weighted more heavily when building the predictions.\n\nCompared to a standard filtering-based approach, Einstein Metrics Guard reduces the risk of false positive and false negative results and minimizes information loss.\n\nIntended Use\n\nThe Einstein Metrics Guard model is intended for these use cases. Anything else is out of scope and not recommended.\n\nThe model provides a layer of information that helps Einstein calculate how trustworthy each email open is. Einstein Metrics Guard is in place in response to mail privacy protection implemented by some email client providers. Einstein can build more accurate models and provide better recommendations.\nEvents that score poorly aren’t included in marketing statistics, and aren’t used to trigger follow-up actions.\nRelevant Factors\n\nThese factors are associated with the Einstein Metrics Guard model.\n\nModel Input\n\nThe engagement history includes these values.\n\nEmail sends, bounces, and engagement events including opens, clicks, unsubscribes, spam complaints, and associated timestamps\nData and metadata about customer sending patterns, including how campaigns are executed\n\nThe engagement history that Einstein Metrics Guard analyzes excludes these factors.\n\nData purchased or collected from third parties\nDemographic data\nSpecific content in an email template or rendered email body\n\nModel Output\n\nTo measure the likelihood that an open is real, the model produces a probabilistic metric score for each open event. The messaging service uses the score to filter out low-scoring activity.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe model is trained and deployed in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Growth environment.\n\nMetrics\n\nEinstein evaluates and monitors model performance metrics to ensure and improve the model quality. Performance measures include data such as model mean absolute error score.\n\nTraining Data\n\nEinstein Metrics Guard is trained using a global model of in-house data and outsourced data. Data from one Salesforce customer doesn’t affect the behavior for another Salesforce customer. Each version of the model uses the global model data with optimized sample weights customized for each customer.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nReview the ethical factors associated with the Einstein Metrics Guard model in Marketing Cloud Growth. To avoid bias and other ethical risks, the model doesn’t include demographic data.\n\nAs you interpret your data, be aware of making assumptions based on the scores generated. Scenarios with potential adverse outcomes can occur in certain circumstances.\n\nEXAMPLE The model predicts low engagement so you choose not to send a marketing communication to a set of customers. If the prediction was erroneous, there could be a negative impact to excluding some of those customers from access to benefits or opportunities.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
