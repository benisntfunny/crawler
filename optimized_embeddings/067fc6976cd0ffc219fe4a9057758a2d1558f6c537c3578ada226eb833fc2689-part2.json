Busy users aren’t always receptive to change so your focus at this point is to win hearts and minds with communication, collaboration, training, and even a little bit of marketing. The Lightning Experience Transition Change Management Hub and Lightning Experience Enablement Pack give you guidance and tools to ensure that your users are well prepared for your launch.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nRecommended change management activities during the Roll Out phase include:\n\nCreate a forum where you can communicate and collaborate with users and stakeholders. We recommend setting up a rollout Chatter group using the Change Management Hub. The Hub streamlines the process, even providing a welcome message template to kick things off on the right note.\nBuild anticipation and excitement before your launch date. Run a drip campaign that promotes Lightning Experience and shows users what’s in it for them. The Hub includes several campaign templates that highlight key Lightning Experience features. You can tailor the messages to reflect your business then use the Hub to share them on Chatter or in other communication channels like email.\nTrain users to work in Lightning Experience so they’re comfortable and productive from day one of your launch. The Hub provides access to several Trailhead modules that are designed for self-paced training. Or set up some in-person training sessions, with help from your Lightning Experience champions. They understand the value of the new interface and the needs of the team, so are a perfect authority to get others on board. Have a champion demo Lightning Experience and show everyone how to complete common tasks. Use the customizable training deck in the Enablement Pack as a starting point.\nSEE ALSO\nManage Change With the Lightning Experience Transition Change Management Hub\nLightning Experience Enablement Pack\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
