Salesforce can't guarantee that restriction rules work as intended for end users who are in the Salesforce Classic experience.\nRestriction rules are available for custom objects, external objects, contracts, events, tasks, time sheets, and time sheet entries.\nIn calendars, if the Show Details access level is selected, users can see the subject of all events, regardless of the restriction rules created. For more information, see Share Your Calendar in Lightning Experience in Salesforce Help.\nApplicable Features\nRestriction rules are applied to the following Salesforce features:\nList Views\nLookups\nRelated Lists\nReports\nSearch\nSOQL\nSOSL\nRestriction rules support custom picklist values in record and user criteria. If you delete a custom picklist value used in a restriction rule, the rule no longer works as intended.\nUse the Activity Timeline instead of activity related lists, such as Open Activities or Activity History. If you use activity related lists, create rules on task or event objects using fields that are only available in the related lists.\nIf you use Open Activities and Activity History related lists, when restriction rules are applied, it’s possible that fewer than 50 records are displayed when more activities exist that the user has access to. This behavior occurs because these lists display at most 50 records, and restriction rules are applied after. This behavior is related to the known issue, Limit of Fifty Records Visible in Related List View.\nAfter restriction rules are applied, users can still see records that they previously had access to in the search box shortcuts list or in the Recently Viewed list view. When users click the record name, they can't access the record and get an error.\nUsers can see their subordinates' events in calendars even if the users have an active restriction rule applied.\nIf a user creates an event or a task record using the Chatter publisher, the record name is visible in the related Chatter post. Restriction rules don’t restrict visibility to these record names.\nUsers can’t clone records that have a lookup to a record that they can’t see due to a restriction rule. For example, you have a restriction rule that prevents a user from seeing a specific contract record, and the user tries to clone an order record that has a lookup to the contract record. The user gets an error, preventing the clone operation from succeeding.\nRestriction rules aren’t applied for code executed in System Mode.\nUsers with the View All or View All Data permissions can view all records regardless of restriction rules. Users with the Modify All or Modify All Data permissions can view, edit, and delete all records regardless of restriction rules.\nA user with a restriction rule applied might not find all possible matching results when searching for a record. For performance reasons, search crowding applies limits to the number of search results. The record the user is looking for can fall outside those limits. Learn how to adjust your searches for the best results at How Search Crowding Affects Search Results.\nThe UserRecordAccess object doesn’t consider whether a user’s access is blocked due to a restriction rule. If a user’s access is blocked even though query results state that they should have access, check to see if a restriction rule on the object prevents the user’s access.\nCreating Restriction Rules\nYou can create up to two restriction rules per object in Enterprise and Developer editions and up to five restriction rules per object in Performance and Unlimited editions.\nCreate only one restriction or scoping rule per object per user. In other words, for a given object, only one restriction or scoping rule at most can have the User Criteria field evaluate to true for a given user.\nCreating a restriction rule for an object doesn’t automatically restrict access to its child objects. For example, if you create a restriction rule for the Contract object, the access doesn’t change for notes that are associated with the affected contract records. To secure these child objects, you must use other sharing mechanisms.\nYou can reference another object’s field using the Record Criteria field. See Restriction Rule Example Scenarios for examples.\nIn the rule’s record criteria, you can’t reference fields on the object’s parent. For example, if you’re creating a rule for the Task object, the record criteria can’t reference a field on the parent Activity object.\nWe support these data types in the User Criteria and Record Criteria fields:\nboolean\ndate\ndateTime\ndouble\nint\nreference\nstring\ntime\nsingle picklist\nNOTE Comma-separated ID or string values are supported in the Record Criteria field.\nRestriction rules support only the EQUALS operator. The use of AND and OR operators isn't supported.\nThe use of formulas isn’t supported.\nDon't create rules on Event.IsGroupEvent, which indicates whether the event has invitees.\nYou can use a change set or unlocked package to move restriction rules from one org to another.\nSome IDs are specific to your Salesforce org, such as role, record type, or profile IDs. If you include these IDs in your User Criteria or Record Criteria fields, keep this consideration in mind when deploying rules between sandboxes or to a production org. You must modify these IDs in the target org if the restriction rules were originally created somewhere else.\nWhen you reference the Owner field, you must specify the object type in your syntax. For example, the Owner field on an Event object can contain a user or a queue, but queues aren’t supported in restriction rules. So it’s necessary to specify Owner:User in the record criteria syntax when the criteria should allow only users.\nRestriction Rules and External Objects\nOnly external objects created using the Salesforce Connect: OData 2.0, OData 4.0, and Cross-Org adapters support restriction rules.\nExternal objects created using the Cross-Org adapter don’t support search or SOSL when a rule is applied to a user. Salesforce returns only search results that match the most recently viewed records.\nExternal objects created using the Salesforce Connect custom adapter aren’t supported.\nExternal object record data is stored outside Salesforce. Admins are responsible for ensuring that rules they create on external objects don’t negatively impact performance in Salesforce or in the external system.\nIMPORTANT\nEditing or deleting a restriction rule on an external object causes an additional database call, which can result in additional billing when the external data source bills per call.\nWhen search is enabled for external object records, searching requires additional database calls each time. Avoid additional charges by turning off search for external object records.\nAs with all restriction rules, using only object fields that are indexed is recommended, especially in record criteria.\nUsing external IDs in record criteria isn’t recommended.\nRestriction rules for external objects don’t include organization-wide defaults or sharing mechanisms.\nExternal objects don’t appear in Object Manager. To navigate to an external object, enter External Data Sources in the Quick Find box in Setup, then select External Data Sources. Select an external object from the list view on this page.\nNOTE You can also find external objects in the Most Recently Used list in Setup.\nPerformance Considerations\n\nRestriction rules were built to support sharing needs in a performant way. Your data volume and architecture are also factors in rule performance.\n\nTo test a rule’s performance impact, take the record criteria to your API client of choice and run the query. If it’s fast for a given user, the rule is likely to run efficiently. For objects with large data volumes, add three to five percent overhead to the record filter’s performance.\nIf it isn’t performant, isolate the field that is slowing performance. Work with Salesforce customer support to get the field indexed.\nSEE ALSO\nKnowledge Article: Improve Performance of SOQL Queries using a Custom Index\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
