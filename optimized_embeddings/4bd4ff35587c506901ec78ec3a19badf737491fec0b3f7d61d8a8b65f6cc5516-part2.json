With Contact Merge, you choose which Contact to keep and what data to preserve from each duplicate.\n\nUnlike standard Salesforce merge, NPSP Contact Merge merges Accounts in certain circumstances. For example, if your merge leaves an Account with no Contacts, NPSP Contact Merge merges the two Accounts, re-parents all the related records from the empty Account to the main Contact’s Account, and deletes the empty Account.\n\nFrom the Contact Merge tab, click Search Contacts to search by Contact name. You can also click See Duplicate Contacts to see a list of duplicate record sets, but you'll need to set up duplicate detection first. For both options, you merge duplicate Contacts manually.\n\nNOTE Contact Merge only supports merging Contacts with Contacts, not Contacts with Leads.\n\nIn addition to Contact Merge, we recommend the following best practices for duplicate management and prevention:\n\nTrain users to search for Contacts before entering new ones. Consider customizing search layouts to give users more information about Contacts, so they can easily see if the Contact already exists.\n\nFormulate a plan to identify duplicate Contacts, including which fields to use to determine if a Contact is a duplicate. For example, you may require entering a middle initial for common names, or you may identify a secondary field to determine a duplicate, like an address or email field.\n\nIMPORTANT Merging Contacts is irreversible. We recommend backing up your data before merging. See Export Backup Data in Salesforce Help.\nAddress Potential Duplicate Contacts from the Contact Page\n\nThe NPSP Potential Duplicates component directs users to the NPSP Contact Merge page where they can review, select, and merge potential duplicate contacts.\n\nThe standard Potential Duplicates component leaves anonymous households behind when used in an org with NPSP. The NPSP Potential Duplicates component fixes this problem by providing an easy way to avoid an unnecessary maintenance burden. It takes the user directly to the Contact Merge page where the potential duplicates are shown and can be resolved. To add this component to the Contact page layout, see Set Up NPSP Potential Duplicates Pane on Contacts Page.\n\nFrom the NPSP Potential Duplicates pane or the potential duplicate toast message on the Contact page, click View Duplicates.\nThe Merge Duplicate Contact Records page opens with the potential duplicates listed in the table.\nFollow the steps in Merge Duplicate Contacts.\nMerge Duplicate Contacts\n\nMerging Contacts is an irreversible process that combines up to three records into one. One of the merged contacts is the master record and the other records are deleted. We recommend that only System Administrators merge Contacts.\n\nBefore You Merge\n\nWe recommend that only the System Administrator merge Contacts, because the merge process is irreversible. To successfully merge Contacts using NPSP Contact Merge, you must have Create, Edit, and Delete permissions on the Contact object. Additionally, at least one of the following must be true:\n\nYou are the owner of the Accounts and Contacts being merged.\nYou are above the owners of the Contacts being merged in the role hierarchy.\nYou have the Modify All permission on Accounts and Contacts.\n\nReview the following before merging Contacts.\n\nExamine the Accounts associated with each of the Contacts to merge and determine which one should be the master Account after the merge.\nReview child records from custom objects for duplicates. When you merge Contacts, all related items from each Contact, such as Opportunities and Payments, are moved to the newly-merged Contact so that no data is lost.\nIf you delete a Contact who is the last member of a Household Account, the process merges that Contact's Household Account with the winning Contact's Household Account.\nRun Duplicate Jobs\n\nIf you have Unlimited Edition or Salesforce.org Insights Platform Data Integrity, run a Duplicate Job to find duplicate Contacts based on your Matching Rule.\n\nClick , then click Setup.\nFrom Setup, enter Duplicate Jobs in the Quick Find box, then click Duplicate Jobs.\nClick New Job.\nSelect the Contact object.\nSelect the Matching Rule you created.\nOptionally change the job name.\nClick Run\n\nFor more information, see Run Duplicate Jobs in Salesforce Help.\n\nMerge Duplicate Contacts\nClick the Contact Merge tab.\nChoose a method to find duplicate Contacts:\nTo search for individual Contacts, click Search Contacts and enter the name of a Contact. You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard, for example, L* Jones finds both Larry Jones and Lawrence Jones. Contact merge will look at all searchable fields including custom ones.\n\nIf you set up Matching Rules and Duplicate Rules or Duplicate Jobs, click See Duplicate Contacts. Select the Duplicate Record Set you want to merge.\n\nSelect up to three Contacts to merge.\nClick Next.\nSelect one Contact as the Master Record. The Master Record determines which Account record the Contact will be associated with after the merge. Contact(s) you don't select will be deleted.\nSelect the field values from any record to preserve in the final merged Contact. Unselected fields will be overwritten. For example, if two records have different phone numbers, select the phone number you want to keep.\nClick Merge, then click Merge.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
