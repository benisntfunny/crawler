It tracks status by quantity. For example, it could show an ordered quantity of 3, a canceled quantity of 1, and a fulfilled quantity of 2. This object is associated with an original order product and the order product summary changes that apply to it, such as returns or cancellations.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nThe read-only Order Item Summary and Order Item Summary Change objects are system-generated and contain summary information related to products in an order. They provide summary information on Order Products, such as the total quantity, total price, and other aggregated data. However, these objects don’t have record-level access or CRUD operations like other standard or custom objects in Salesforce.\n\nIf you must perform CRUD operations on Order Products records, work with the Order Item object that represents an individual line item or product in an order. The Order Item object supports CRUD operations, and you can create, read, update, and delete specific Order Product records. To access and manage Order Products records, use the Order Item object instead.\n\nThis table lists the fields on the Order Product Summary object.
