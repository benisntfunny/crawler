Does your team have the product knowledge and know-how to sell with conviction and passion?\nTrain your team to be proactive to explain how your products can relieve pain points that customers may not be aware of.\nEncourage your team to focus on making deeper connections before they grow their client lists, crunch numbers, and worry about details like call times.

A healthy team shows compassion and support when times are tough.\n\nOur recommendations:\n\nReach out to team members who struggle more than others. Are there work or personal reasons or extenuating circumstances for performance decline?\nKeep an eye on factors outside your team’s control, such as product and service issues or competitive threats. An outside perspective can help lift morale when your team is feeling down.\nUpdate or improve sales training and management reviews during low points. The extra attention can help support sales.\nStay up-to-date on industry news to help your team innovate their sales techniques.
