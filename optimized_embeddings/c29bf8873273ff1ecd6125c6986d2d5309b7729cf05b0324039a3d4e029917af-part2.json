On the Net Zero Marketplace platform, organizations may also enter into carbon credit purchases on a voluntary basis. Salesforce is not a party to those voluntary agreements. Net Zero Marketplace is not a compliance carbon marketplace, where regulated entities like energy producers are required to buy or sell credits.\n\nCarbon projects are implemented by ecopreneurs, and the purchase of carbon credits can help to finance a project run by an ecopreneur. These projects go through independent verification against global standards. If they pass the verification process, the organizations running the projects can issue carbon credits, which can then be sold.\n\nCarbon projects are projects that seek to avoid, remove, or reduce CO2 or another Greenhouse Gas (GHG) in the atmosphere. Projects can include forest conservation, tree planting, wind farms, solar cookstoves, or better farming methods. Every tonne of CO2 or equivalent emissions reduced or removed by an environmental project creates one carbon credit.\n\nCarbon credits represent the avoidance, reduction, or removal of emissions of greenhouse gases in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. They are measured in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (tCO2e). One carbon credit is equal to one tCO2e reduced or removed from the atmosphere.\n\nHere’s a simplified look at how it works:\n\nAn ecopreneur creates a carbon project.\n\nThe carbon project is reviewed and validated by an independent body.\n\nCarbon credits are made available for sale.\n\nBusinesses purchase credits as they work to reduce their own emissions.\n\nThose purchases allow ecopreneurs to recoup costs and scale positive impact.\n\nThe climate crisis impacts everyone, and each of us must play a role in our collective journey to limit global warming to 1.5°C. To avoid surpassing 1.5°C of warming, we must collectively cut emissions in half by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by mid-century (source). Reaching this milestone requires both deeply decreasing our emissions and, at the same time, removing CO2 that has already been added to the atmosphere.\n\nThe top priority in any organization’s net zero journey must be to reduce emissions. However, reaching the level of decarbonization that science tells us is needed to limit warming to 1.5°C is dependent on systemic societal changes that take time. This means that while emissions reduction goals should be prioritized, to reach them, companies must also seek to affect change outside their own operations.\n\nCarbon credits — and carbon markets more generally — are critical tools that, made and used well, can play an important role in our collective journey to net zero while simultaneously helping us build a nature-positive world. While carbon markets today are far from perfect, they are one of the best tools we have for financing critical climate solutions. The promise of the voluntary carbon market (VCM) lies in its potential to scale, from hundreds of millions of US dollars today to $10B–$40B by 2030, spurring innovation and fueling the emergence of a large economic sector for nature-based solutions and technological carbon dioxide removal that the world desperately needs.\n\nNet Zero Marketplace FAQ\nGet answers to common questions about Net Zero Marketplace.\nExplore Net Zero Marketplace\nNet Zero Marketplace is open to all to explore.
