Commerce Marketplace has two record types for the Marketplace Product object: Seller Imported and Marketplace Item. The seller creates the Seller Imported record type in the Seller Portal and sends it to you for approval and integration.\n\nImport the List of Products\nWhen you import data about products into Commerce Marketplace, the record type that is created is called a Marketplace Item.\nManually Import Marketplace Products\nYou can manually upload to the Marketplace a template list of products available on WebDAV.\nApprove a Seller’s Marketplace Products\nYou can approve or reject the products that a seller submits. However, if the seller submits a product that exists in the Marketplace, you match their product to avoid multiple pages with the same product in the storefront. You can manually match a product or set up automatic approval when a product match has the same price that you entered in the Marketplace or lower.\nApprove an Unmatched Product\nYou can also approve a product that hasn’t been matched.\nRegister a Product Variant (SKU)\nTo appear in the Marketplace, each product must have at least one variant record with stock and price entries.\nApprove a Specification Match\nMatching a specification combines the product attributes you entered with the product attributes entered by different sellers. You define these matches to prevent duplications of the same attribute in the storefront. After the seller’s and Marketplace’s specifications are matched, you approve them.\nUpload a Product Image\nYou can upload the image of a product in different colors and sizes. For an image to be used on the storefront, you create an image record in the sidebar. The images uploaded in the Product and Product Variant objects aren’t uploaded to the storefront.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
