The link takes the customer to a branded, mobile-responsive payment web page where they can enter their payment details. Add a payment link to any Salesforce record for integration into existing workflows. To create a payment link, use the Generate Payment Link flow, which guides you through the link creation process. How you incorporate a link into your business application is specific to your work flow.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions\n\nThis procedure assumes knowledge of Salesforce declarative tools and working with objects.\n\nEstablish a lookup relationship between the Payment Link object and the object that you want to accept payments for.\nThe lookup relationship creates a record of what the payment link is for. For example, to collect payment for an invoice or work order, add a lookup field on the Invoice or Work Order object.\nFrom Setup, go to Object Manager and locate the Payment Link object.\nSelect Fields & Relationships.\nClick New, and select Lookup Relationship.\nFollow the prompts, and select the object that you want the Payment Link to relate to.\nIn Flow Builder, the Generate Payment Link flow automates payment link generation. You can use the flow as is or customize it.\nIf you want to customize the flow, complete these tasks. Otherwise, go to the next step.\nIn Setup, and in the Quick Find box, enter flows, and select Flows.\nSelect the Generate Payment Link flow, save it under a new name, then modify it.\nYou can also build your own application workflow using the Payment Link object and a Salesforce declarative tool, such as Flow or Quick Actions. You can also use a developer tool, like Apex invocable actions.\nAdd the payment link flow as an action to an object’s page layout.\nFrom Object Manager, choose the object that you want to create a payment link from.\nSelect Buttons, Links, and Actions, and then click New Action.\nFor Action Type, select Flow and select the payment link flow.\nEnter a label and name for the link, and save your changes.\nSelect Page Layouts.\nFrom Mobile and Lightning Actions, drag the action that you created to the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section of the page layout.\nA button to generate a payment link is added to all record pages for the object. You can generate as many payment links as you want for a single object.\nPay Now doesn’t perform post-processing logic, so you must configure automation for post-payment processing. For example, when a payment is received, add a process to mark an invoice as paid with the amount sent.\nTest your action button to ensure that it triggers the flow. When the flow starts, select the type of payment link you want to create.\nPredefined Amount directs a customer to the Pay page at the Pay Now site. It shows the amount owed, including taxes, which you calculate and enter manually when you configure the link.\nWith Products requires that you enable person accounts for your org. How this link operates depends on whether you’re using Payments alone or with Commerce.\n\nIf org uses Salesforce Payments without Commerce, the With Products link goes to the Pay page at the Pay Now site. It shows the amount owed, including taxes, which you calculate and enter manually when you configure the link.\n\nIf your org uses Salesforce Payments and Commerce, the With Products link maps to the Checkout with Order functionality in the PaymentLink object. The link directs customers to the Checkout page at the Pay Now site. This page shows a list of products, calculates the tax based on the shipping address and products purchased, and provides shipping options. After the customer completes the transaction, an order record is created, which you can view using an integrated order management product, such as Salesforce Order Management.\n\nWhen you create a payment link, you enter a payment method set that determines which methods you accept. The set you enter must contain payment methods that support the default currency of the Pay Now site. For example, if the default currency is euros, the payment method set must contain payment methods that support euros.\nIf your payment link takes you to an error page, go to the Payments Link list view and verify that the link’s status is active. Next, open the link in your browser’s private or incognito browsing mode.\nTest the generated payment link to make sure that it takes you to the correct Pay Now page. If you accept payments with Apple Pay, test the link by opening it in a Safari browser.\nEXAMPLE In Object Manager, modify the Quote object. Add an action named Generate Payment Link to the Quote page layout. When you click the new Generate Payment Link button on the page, the flow starts and walks you through payment link creation. Copy the resulting link and share it with your customer.\nSEE ALSO\nAutomate Your Business Processes\nFlow Builder\nQuick Actions\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
