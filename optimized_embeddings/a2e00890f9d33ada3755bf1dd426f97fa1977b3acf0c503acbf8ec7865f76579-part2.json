This content provides information about these solutions. Find the managed package documentation in Salesforce for Nonprofits. If you’re not sure which version your organization uses, check with your Salesforce admin.\n\nWith Program Management, you can define a program model that contains details of a program, its benefits, the delivery plan, and the receiving participants.\n\nFor example, Sui, a program manager, creates a Youth Job Readiness Program that is planned from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023 with an objective to enhance youth employability skills and make them career-ready. She further defines benefits like resume writing workshop, interviewing skills sessions, and personal grooming sessions. She adds participants to the program. With Program Management, Sui can easily track and manage the program and its overall progress.\n\nDefine Units of Measure for Program Management\nAdd units of measure to specify the predefined units for the quantity of benefits.\nCreate Benefit Types for a Program\nCreate a benefit type that groups benefits in a program. Benefit types can be broadly classified into service, goods, and monetary types.\nCreate Programs\nCreate a program to track and manage your nonprofit initiative, and offer benefits to your participants.\nManage Program Cohorts and Cohort Members\nGroup participants together in a program to make sure individuals don't slip through the cracks, and track them as a group over time. Remove a cohort member and retain their history in the cohort.\nAdd Participants to a Program\nAdd participants to your program.\nAdd Benefits to a Program\nAdd benefits to a program to detail out the activities that the program offers.\nTrack Tasks and Documents for Your Programs and Benefits\nUse action plan templates to define a checklist of the repeatable tasks and documentation requirements or necessary approvals for your programs and benefits. An action plan is a run-time instance of the template that allows you to automate the sequence of the tasks you defined in the template.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
