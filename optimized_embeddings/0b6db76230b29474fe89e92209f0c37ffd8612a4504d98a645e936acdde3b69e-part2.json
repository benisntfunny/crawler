This release includes several fixes that resulted from your submitted cases.\n\nNOTE\nSome fixes were also patched in previous versions of B2B Commerce for Visualforce. If you're upgrading from a version where a fix was patched, you probably already resolved any required upgrade steps.\nSome fixes update default handlebars.js templates that render components on the storefront. If you've previously overridden a default template that receives a fix, reimplement your customizations based on the fixed version of the default template. This step ensures that custom code in your solution receives the benefit of the fix.\nID\tALSO PATCHED IN\tFIX\nW-7270231\t—\tFixed an issue where the Reorder widget didn't show the correct recent order history for a selected effective account. This issue occurred when the Filter Effective Account configuration of the My Account module was TRUE. When a buyer placed an order from one child account and then selected a different effective child account, all orders from the parent-child account hierarchy appeared. The widget didn't show only the selected child account's orders as expected.\nW-7241492\t—\tFixed an issue where component product images didn't appear on a dynamic kit's Product Detail page. This issue occurred when adding two of the same component products to a dynamic kit. The products image for the second product didn't appear.\nW-7208175\t—\tFixed an issue where the Product Compare page didn’t show a product’s alternate name. This issue occurred when the Alternate Name field on the product record had a value, which was supposed to take precedence over the Product Name field.\nW-7201767\t—\tFixed a rare issue where reassigning record ownership caused checkout to fail after resolving security alerts for guest user access.\nW-7183255\tB2B Commerce for Visualforce Spring ’19 (version 4.10) patch 3.142.23\tFixed an issue where an invoice's Status field in the My Invoices section of the My Account page showed the invoice’s type, not status.\nW-7182402\t—\t\n\nFixed an issue where a cart was created with an incorrect Effective Account ID. This issue occurred when a CSR user:\n\nLogged in from a contact record for one account and created a cart\nThen, logged in from a different contact record for a different account and created another cart\n\nThe second cart referenced the Effective Account ID of the account that was used to create the first cart.\n\n\nW-7176048\t—\t\n\nFixed an issue where CC Page Labels with i18n entries weren't getting translated for the cc_MyAccountChangePasswordRD.component, which renders the Submit button on the Change Password page. This fix adds a new, generic page label record for the Submit string.\n\nUpgrade impact: To add the page label to your org, go to CC Admin | Global Settings | | Data Loader and click Upgrade B2B Commerce Settings after you upgrade.\n\n\nW-7097666\t—\tFixed an issue where the ccrz.ccServiceFeatured data service class wasn’t extensible by subscriber code.\nW-7035690\t—\tFixed an issue where the Header and Search Box widgets didn't display when overriding the default sections in the My Account page.\nW-7018699\tB2B Commerce for Visualforce Summer ’19 (version 4.11) patch 3.145.14\t\n\nFixed an issue in the Effective Account selector for an account name that contained a symbol (such as &). The account name rendered with the symbol’s HTML code (such as &amp;) instead of the symbol itself.\n\nUpgrade impact: This fix updates the default EffAcctSel-Widget-View-Desktop Handlebars template. If you've previously overridden this default template, reimplement your customizations based on the fixed version of the default template. This step ensures that custom code in your solution receives the benefit of the fix.\n\n\nW-6940206\t—\t\n\nFixed an issue where a cart selected from the My Carts section of the My Account page didn’t match the currently selected effective account.\n\nUpgrade impact: With this change, the effectiveAccountId field is now included in SZ_M return data for the ccrz.ccApiCart.fetch() method. Previously, this field was included in SZ_XL return data.\n\n\nW-6852050\tB2B Commerce for Visualforce Summer ’18 (version 4.9) patch 3.136.34\t\n\nFixed an issue where an order item’s status didn’t appear on the Order View page.\n\nUpgrade impact: With this change, the orderItemStatus field is now included in SZ_XL return data for the ccrz.ccApiOrder.fetchOrderItems() method.\n\n\nW-6847190\t—\tFixed an issue where the ccrz.CCCatSiteMap Visualforce page used for creating a sitemap returned an exception. The issue occurred when a category included a large volume of products with price list items that a guest user was entitled to.\nW-6800437\t—\tFixed an issue where the Timezone field on the My Account page didn't display properly. This issue occurred when the Show Time Zone configuration of the Registration module was TRUE.\nW-6572410\t—\tFixed an issue where a coupon's price amount didn't display on the Order Review page's Order Review and Order Confirmation sections. This issue occurred only for the Order Review page version 1.0.\nW-6173097\tCloudCraze 4.8 patch 3.133.25\tFixed an issue where multiple CC Order records were created. This issue occurred when a buyer pressed the space bar, Enter (Windows), or Return (macOS) multiple times after clicking the Process Payment button during checkout.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
