View and update key details about a file from the File Details page.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Professional,Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Contact Manager, and Developer Editions\nPreview a File\n\nClicking a file from Files Home or in a related list opens the File Previewer, which lets you view the file without downloading it. Use the arrow keys in the previewer to see each page, zoom in or out, or change the preview width and screen size. Files can be previewed by the file owner and anyone with access to the file.\n\nNOTE\nOnly the first 500 pages of very large files are rendered in the preview. If your org has migrated to Hyperforce, only the first 100 pages may be rendered in the preview.\nYou can’t preview files larger than 25 MB or 500 pages, unknown file types, password-protected files, and copy-protected PDFs.\nFor files that you can’t preview, the Preview option isn’t available on feeds or list views, and files appear as generic file type icons in the feed.\nSome Microsoft Office 2007 features don’t display correctly in previews.\nSome extended characters, such as ellipsis, and formatting can appear inconsistently in previews.\nIf a file can be previewed, but a preview doesn’t exist, contact your Salesforce admin to request to regenerate the preview.\nIn the file previewer, the heading overlay menu disappears after 5 seconds of inactivity. Move the mouse or press tab to make the menu reappear.\nPreviews for CMS images and files aren’t visible in Firefox when the browser security is set to standard. This occurs because the standard Firefox security policy blocks third-party domain cookies. To preview CMS content set the security policy to custom and allow cookies.\nView and Edit File Details in Lightning Experience\n\nClick View File Details from a file preview or from the actions menu on Files home, in the feed, or on a record. From the file details page, you can see key details about the file, including size, extension, and file owner. View or update the file title and description. View information about sharing and file versions.\n\nTo edit file details\n\nOn a file detail page, click Edit Details\nEdit the title and description\nClick Save\n\nFile owners, collaborators, and users with the “Modify All Data” permission can edit file details. Admins can customize the page layout of the Files detail page. If you have a custom layout, you see it displays when you view or edit file details from the actions arrow on Files home, or when you edit file details from a file preview.\n\nNOTE If you click Edit File Details from the files related list on a record, the default file detail page displays instead of the custom layout. To see the custom file detail page layout on a file attached to a record, click the file title to open the file preview, and then click Edit File Details.\nView and Edit File Details in Salesforce Classic\nSee if the file is private, privately shared, or shared with your company.\nClick File Sharing Settings to share a file with people, groups, or via file link; or to see the file’s Sharing Settings.\nClick Make private on the Sharing Settings dialog box to remove the file and file link, if applicable, from everywhere that it's been shared. Or click Restrict access to remove the file from everywhere that it's been shared except the library (only for files that originated in a Salesforce CRM Content library). .\n\nBy default, anyone who can see a file can share it. Only owners and users with the “Modify all Data” permission can make a file private or restrict access.\n\nTake Action\nClick Download to open or save the file.\nClick Upload New Version to update the file with a newer version.\nClick Edit Details to edit the name or description of the file.\nClick Delete to delete the file.\nRead the file description. Add a description by clicking Add Description, or click the edit icon to edit the description.\nNOTE After you delete a file, it can remain cached for up to 90 days.\n\nAnyone who can see a file can download it. Only file owners, collaborators, and users with the “Modify all Data” permission can upload a new version of a file or edit file details. Only file owners and users with the “Modify All Data” permission can delete files.\n\nGet More Information\nSee who owns the file and when it was last modified.\nSee the file's current version number and click Show all versions to see the file's version history.\nClick Show file report to see data about the file, such as how many times the file has been downloaded, shared, liked, and commented on. Show file report is visible only to users with the “Run Reports” and “View Reports in Public Folders” permissions.\nClick Follow to follow the file, or click X to stop following the file.\nSee who's following the file.\nSee who the file is shared with.\nClick Go to Content Detail Page to see the content detail page of that file. Some actions performed on files that originated in Salesforce CRM Content must be taken on the file's content detail page rather than the file detail page.\nSee other files that people who viewed this file also viewed.\nSEE ALSO\nView File Version History\nView Where a File Is Shared\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
