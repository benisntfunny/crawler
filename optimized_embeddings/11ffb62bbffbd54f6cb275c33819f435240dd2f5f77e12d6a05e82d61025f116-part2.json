Because reference data can vary due to different factors, such as regions, you can use other sources to get reference data that’s more accurate for your specific energy consumption. You can select the included reference datasets or purchase additional datasets from Net Zero Marketplace. Some datasets are integrated with Net Zero Cloud and some you have to upload to Net Zero Cloud using a CSV file.\n\nNet Zero Cloud is flexible and non-prescriptive for managing reference data and emissions factors. Check the accuracy of the factors, and modify them or add your own to suit your organization. Limit user access to add, change, or delete data as needed. Determine which emissions factors to apply, because Net Zero Cloud doesn’t assume which factor to use in a calculation.\n\nUse of third-party datasets can be subject to certain terms and conditions (see Salesforce Notices and License Information). For more information, see the Trust and Compliance site.\n\nWhich Reference Data to Load?\nUse the reference datasets from standard environmental bodies to convert your energy consumption data into reportable carbon numbers. As reference data can vary with factors such as region, you can use the published sources or other sources to get reference data that’s most accurate for your specific energy consumption.\nUpload Emissions Factors Datasets into Net Zero Cloud\nNet Zero Cloud supports emissions factors that are either free and provided out of the box (OOTB) by Salesforce, or emissions factors available for purchase from providers on the Net Zero Marketplace. For purchased emissions factors, the loading steps are the same after you pay the invoice.\nView Current Dataset Version Details\nView the current version of the emissions factors loaded for each reference dataset.\nUpdate an Emissions Factor Dataset\nUpdate your existing reference dataset to a new version. This process overwrites data in fields in existing emissions factors for the selected dataset. If you don’t want these records updated, lock the reference data record. It’s recommended to enable history tracking for emissions factors.\nGrant View Access to Dataset Load History\nSet up organization-wide sharing settings for the Reference Data Load Log object so that all your users can view the dataset load history from any other user.\nOther Available Reference Data Sources\nAs reference data can vary with factors such as regions, you can use other sources to get reference data that’s more accurate for your specific energy consumption. Due to licensing restrictions, the reference datasets included with Net Zero Cloud doesn’t include all data sources. You can download or purchase such reference datasets from other providers and then upload to Net Zero Cloud.\nSEE ALSO\nField History Tracking\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
