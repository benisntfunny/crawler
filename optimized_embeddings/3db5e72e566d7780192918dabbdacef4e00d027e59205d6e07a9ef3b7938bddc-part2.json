Create policies that capture the objects you want to delete or make anonymous, then manually run the policy on a specific record at any time.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Developer, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions. Requires the Privacy Center license.\n\nRTBF policies are created at the object level to ensure that all customer data is removed. You can include multiple child objects for each parent object that you include in a policy, with the option to cascade down four levels in the child object hierarchy. Your policy transforms all records in the primary object and any included child objects.\n\nWhen you run an RTBF policy it enters the same queue as Data Management policies and runs when any earlier scheduled policies finish running.\n\nCreate Right to Be Forgotten Policies\nHonor individual customer requests to remove or mask sensitive data by creating Right to Be Forgotten policies.\nCreate and Run a Right to Be Forgotten Request\nCreate a request record and assign a policy to run on Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF) requests from your customers.\nImport and Export Privacy Policies Between Orgs\nConfigure and test a privacy policy in one org, then use it in another. If you test your policies in a sandbox, you can create a copy of the policy to import and use in your production org.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
