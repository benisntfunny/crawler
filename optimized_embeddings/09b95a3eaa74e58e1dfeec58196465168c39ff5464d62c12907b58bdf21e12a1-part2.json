Use it to evaluate and update items such as Visualforce pages, JavaScript buttons and links, hard-coded URLs, actions and buttons, and AppExchange packages.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS OR FEATURES\nNEEDED\nTo run the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter:\tCustomize Application, Modify All Data\nNOTE Get the full picture of your org by running the Lightning Experience Readiness Check as well as using the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter.\nNOTE The Lightning Experience Configuration Converter is a standalone application that lives outside your ordinary Salesforce environment. When you use it, your account will be used to pull relevant data from your Salesforce org into Heroku, where the data will be processed to provide the Configuration Converter's functionality. Heroku is another service offered by Salesforce on a separate infrastructure. The Configuration Converter may also use further downstream processors, including third parties. Tell me more about Heroku.\n\nTo check your progress, Salesforce recommends scanning each feature area at least one time each release.\n\nOpen a tab in your browser, and log in to the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter at https://lightning-configuration.salesforce.com/.\n\nWe recommend running the tool in a sandbox or Developer Edition org, and then migrating changes to your production org.\n\nReview the status of each feature on the Home tab.\nTo update the status of a feature, kick off a scan of that feature from the Home tab.\nNOTE While the Configuration Converter is running a scan, you can’t view scan results on any tab, take conversion actions, or kick off another scan. You can close the Configuration Converter while a scan is in progress. Salesforce sends you an email when the scan is finished.\nIf this is your first time using the tool, scan each feature.\nReview and act on scan results.\nSEE ALSO\nSandboxes: Staging Environments for Customizing and Testing\nCheck Your Org’s Readiness for Lightning Experience\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
