Your admin can also let you include attachments. You can email posts to a private or unlisted group only if you’re a member. Use the email address associated with your Salesforce user account.\n\nTo launch a blank email to the group using your local email client, go to the group detail page, and click Post by email below the group description.\nEnter your message in the email body, including attachments if needed, and send the email.\nAttachments to the email are added as files in Chatter and shared with the group.\n\nThe email content displays as a post on the group detail page. Any hashtags that you include in the email body (for example, #TeamExcellence) are converted to topics on the post. If you include more than one attachment , the first attachment is added as part of the post and other attachments are added in comments.\n\nTIP Save the group’s email address as a contact in your mail client or mobile device for easy access in the future. If you copy and paste the mailto: link directly into the contact’s email field, some mail clients can consider the link invalid and prevent you from sending email to the contact. Try removing the parenthetical group name from the first part of the email address. For example, remove (My Group) from (My Group)0f9b000000004cmkaq@post.k-pxyvmac.kp0.chatter.salesforce.com.\n\nThe following limitations apply to posting to a group using email:\n\nThe 10,000 character limit for Chatter posts also applies to posts created through email. Any text in your email beyond this limit is not included in the post.\nThe maximum message size is 25 MB, including text and attachments.\nThe email subject is not included in the post.\nYou can create text posts using email and include links in the text. You can also include up to 25 attachments. You can’t mention people, create polls, or give titles to links when posting to the group by email.\nCharacter-level formatting, such as the use of bold or different type sizes, is not supported.\nEmail addresses must be unique at the group level. Imagine that multiple user profiles in your organization use the same email address. If that address is used to post to a group, then the user profile associated with the group is used on the post. If the email address is shared between multiple user profiles in the same group, the email is blocked.\nSignature text is treated as part of your post. Default signatures inserted by mobile devices, such as Sent from my iPhone, are automatically removed. Before sending your email, delete custom signatures and any extra text that you don't want posted to Chatter. Or, add a separator line to the top of your signature to have it automatically removed. The separator line must have a minimum of one of the following characters:\nDash (-)\nEqual sign (=)\nUnderscore (_)\nYou can also use any combination of these characters or double-dash space (-- ), which respects RFC 3676 4.3.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
