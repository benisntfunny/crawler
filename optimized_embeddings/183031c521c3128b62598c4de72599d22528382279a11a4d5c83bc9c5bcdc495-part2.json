This affects Elevate Advanced Edition, Elevate Power of Us Editions, and all add-ons. As part of this product retirement, the ability to renew subscriptions to this product will end on October 1, 2023, and we anticipate that the product will be deactivated on or after October 1, 2024.\nImport a Test File\nBefore you import tens, hundreds, or thousands of records, test your import file and verify the results to confirm your full file will process smoothly.\nImport the Full File\nNow that you verified the format of the import file through a successful test with a subset of your data, import the remainder of your file.\nCheck the Full Import\nCheck the full report to understand which files were imported successfully and which failed.\nStop Processing with Legacy Provider\nOnce you've completed your import, make sure your constituents aren't charged by Elevate as well as your legacy service provider.\nClose or Delete Open Opportunities\nOnce you've completed your import, close or delete any existing open Opportunities that are related to Elevate-connected Recurring Donations.\nConsiderations for Importing Large Data Sets\nScheduled rollup jobs can cause errors when importing a large data set that takes several hours to process.\nImport a Test File\n\nBefore you import tens, hundreds, or thousands of records, test your import file and verify the results to confirm your full file will process smoothly.\n\nTo test your import:\n\nMove 5-10 records to a new CSV file.\n\nFollow the instructions in Import the Full File to import the test file.\n\nVerify the import and integration with Salesforce ran as expected by reviewing the records in the Success file. Learn more about reviewing results in Explore Results Files and NPSP Error Log.\n\nFind the Recurring Donation record in Elevate.\n\nConfirm the Elevate record contains the information you expected.\n\nClick View in Salesforce to confirm the Elevate record is connected to the correct Salesforce Recurring Donation record.\n\nIf any records weren't successfully created in Salesforce, follow the instructions in Troubleshoot Import Integration Issues to correct the issues.\n\nRepeat these steps for every record in your test file.\n\nIf your import produced a Failure file, fix the errors and run the test import again until all of the records are successfully imported.\n\nApply any fixes you made to the test file to the full file.\n\nIf your full import file contains a significant number of records, you may want to run another test with 10% of the records from the full file.\n\nImport the Full File\n\nNow that you verified the format of the import file through a successful test with a subset of your data, import the remainder of your file.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nDo not import your entire file unless you've completed a test import. See Import a Test File for more information.\n\nIf you have a large number of records to import, see Considerations for Importing Large Data Sets.\n\nNOTE You can instead import using API endpoints. Learn more in Commitments Import (POST) API - Create a File Import Session, Commitments Import (PATCH) API - Start a File Import Session, and Commitments Import (GET) API - Get a File Import Session.\n\nGo to Payments Management | Imports.\n\nClick Import Recurring Donations.\n\nFind and select your CSV file.\n\nSelect the Payment Gateway.\n\nClick Import.\n\nThe Status column displays one of these values:\n\nProcessing...\nThe import is running.\nFailed\nElevate can't process the import file. Make sure your file is correctly saved as a CSV.\nProcessed\nThe import is complete and Elevate imported some or all of the records in your file.\nCheck the Full Import\n\nCheck the full report to understand which files were imported successfully and which failed.\n\nThe processed row has a linked Success file for the records that were imported, and if applicable, a link for a Failure file that contains records that failed to import. Read more about the results files and how to troubleshoot common issues in Review Import Results.\n\nHere's a short summary of how to check the full import:\n\nIf you see a Failure file associated with your import, download it to review and fix the errors. Then, remove the leading column that contains the error message, save it as a CSV, and re-import the corrected CSV file.\n\nDownload the Success file and spot check the imported records for accuracy in Elevate as well as in Salesforce.\n\nIn Salesforce, check the Error Log for imported records that didn't get created in Salesforce. See Troubleshoot Import Integration Issues for more information.\n\nNOTE If you see an error in the Salesforce Error Log that reads \"Valid Payment Methods for an active Elevate-connected Recurring Donation are Credit Card or ACH.\", you need to update a picklist field value in Salesforce. For the Payment Method field on the Recurring Donation object, update the API Name for the ACH value from ACH/EFT to ACH.\nStop Processing with Legacy Provider\n\nOnce you've completed your import, make sure your constituents aren't charged by Elevate as well as your legacy service provider.\n\nTurn off recurring donation processing for your legacy services provider for the transactions that moved to Elevate or contact your legacy service provider to do so.\n\nClose or Delete Open Opportunities\n\nOnce you've completed your import, close or delete any existing open Opportunities that are related to Elevate-connected Recurring Donations.\n\nOtherwise, when Elevate processes the next installment, there will be a duplicate Opportunity for the same installment.\n\nCreate a report to locate open Opportunities related to Elevate-connected Recurring Donations:Create a report using the Opportunities and Recurring Donation report type.\n\nCreate a report using the Opportunities and Recurring Donation report type.\n\nMake the following adjustments the report Filters:\n\nShow Me = All opportunities.\n\nClose Date = All Time.\n\nOpportunity Status = Open.\n\nProbability = All.\n\nElevate Recurring Id not equal to blank.\n\nAdd the Opportunity ID column.\n\nAdd or remove additional columns as needed.\n\nSave the report.\n\nUse the report data along with Salesforce Data Loader or a similar data manipulation tool to update or delete the Opportunity records.\n\nConsiderations for Importing Large Data Sets\n\nScheduled rollup jobs can cause errors when importing a large data set that takes several hours to process.\n\nTo avoid rollup errors when importing a large data set, delete the Enhanced Recurring Donation and Customizable Rollup batch jobs prior to starting the import process.\n\nIn Setup, go to Scheduled Jobs.\n\nClick Del next to these Scheduled Jobs:\n\nAll Scheduled Jobs with \"Customizable Rollups\" in the name. For example, NPSP 02A - Customizable Rollups - Contact Hard Credit.\n\nNPSP 06 - Enhanced Recurring Donation Updates.\n\nEach time you delete a Scheduled Job, click OK in the popup window.\n\nAfter you complete the full Recurring Donation import, recreate the Scheduled Jobs by clicking the NPSP Settings tab or launching it from the App Launcher. Loading the NPSP Settings page recreates all the deleted NPSP Scheduled Jobs.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
