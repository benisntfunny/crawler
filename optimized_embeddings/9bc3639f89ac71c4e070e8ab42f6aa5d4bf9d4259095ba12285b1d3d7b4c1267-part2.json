This tool produces a personalized Readiness Report that shows which of your users will benefit right away, and how to adjust your implementation for Lightning Experience. Most existing features and customizations just work in Lightning Experience, so you may be delighted to learn there's nothing significant to address. The report is a valuable resource that helps you focus on updates that smooth the way as you roll out Lightning Experience.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nThe Readiness Check and the Readiness Report are available in English only.\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo run the Lightning Experience Readiness Check\t\n\nCustomize Application\n\nAND\n\nModify All Data\n\nNOTE Starting in October 2019, the Readiness Check report is stored in your Salesforce files instead of being attached to an email.\nNOTE The Lightning Experience Readiness Check is a standalone application that lives outside your ordinary Salesforce environment. When you use it, your account will be used to pull relevant data from your Salesforce org into Heroku, where the data will be processed to provide the Readiness Check's functionality. Heroku is another service offered by Salesforce on a separate infrastructure. The Readiness Check may also use further downstream processors, including third parties. Tell me more about Heroku.\n\nSome Readiness Reports also include ROI calculations to help you make the case to your leadership and stakeholders, and an estimated level of effort for your rollout. Plus you get access to a free group session with a Lightning Experience expert for advice on next steps.\n\nRunning the Readiness Check doesn’t change your Salesforce implementation. Other Salesforce admins or users aren’t alerted when you run the tool.\n\nTIP\n\nWe’re continually updating and expanding the scope of what the Readiness Check evaluates, so we recommend rerunning the tool occasionally. If you’re in the early stages of your transition, run the check every 2-3 months to see what’s new. If you’re actively rolling out Lightning Experience, run the check monthly, if not more often.\n\nWho Can Run the Lightning Experience Readiness Check?\nLearn what’s required to run the Readiness Check and the factors that control the availability of certain sections in the Readiness Report.\nWhat Does the Lightning Experience Readiness Check Evaluate?\nSee how to use your Readiness Report for estimates on the ways Lightning Experience can improve user productivity and for a projected level of effort to roll out Lightning Experience. Learn how the report assesses the readiness of your org’s user profiles, and which features and customizations are evaluated. You can use these details to develop your rollout plan and prioritize what to focus on.\nHow Does the Lightning Experience Readiness Check Count User Impact?\nFor some of your features, the Readiness Report provides details on how many users are working with the feature in Salesforce Classic, and how often. The Readiness Check bases user counts on different types of data or metadata, depending on what’s available for each feature.\nKick Off the Lightning Experience Readiness Check\nTo evaluate the readiness of your users and many of your org’s features and customizations for Lightning Experience, run the Readiness Check. Access the tool from the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant.\nSEE ALSO\nGet Started with the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter\nWhat are the Gaps Between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
