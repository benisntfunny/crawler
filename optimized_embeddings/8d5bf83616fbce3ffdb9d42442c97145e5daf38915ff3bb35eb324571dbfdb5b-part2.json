Before you get started, you must set up the document types and document categories. Then, you can define the decision criteria that the Document Matrix element uses to dynamically identify the required documents. The documents that the respondents upload are automatically saved as document checklist Items and attached to the assessment record.\n\nYour users can upload documents only if they’re assigned the Document Checklist Item permission set and Run Decision Table permission. The document matrix component isn't available for communities and guest users.\n\nExplore and Learn\n\nWatch this video how to learn to streamline the assessment process and ensure respondents upload correct documents by using the Discovery Framework Document Matrix element for a Financial Services scenario.\n\nIf you aren’t able to watch the view in full screen, open the video on a new tab:  Streamline Document Uploads in Assessments Using Discovery Framework Document Matrix Element.\n\nSet Up Document Types for Document Matrix\nDefine common required document types to associate a new document checklist item with a document type. For example, set up document types such as Driving License, SSN, and Birth Certificate.\nSet Up Document Categories\nDefine document categories to organize document checklist items into logical groups. For example, create the categories Identity Proof, Address Proof, and SSN.\nAssociate a Document Type with a Document Category\nUse the Document Category Document Type junction object to link a document type to a document category. For example, associate the document types Driving License and SSN with the Identity Proof document category.\nDefine Business Rules\nUse the Document Decision Requirement object to specify the criteria that the Document Matrix element uses to determine which documents the respondent must upload for an assessment.\nCreate a Decision Table for the Document Matrix Element\nAfter you've defined the document decision rules in a Document Decision Requirement record, you can create decision tables to determine the outcome.\nAdd a Document Matrix Element to an Assessment Form Layout\nThe Document Matrix element for Discovery Framework–based OmniScripts uses a decision table to determine which documents a respondent must upload when submitting an assessment. For each required document, a File input element is automatically added to the assessment form layout at runtime.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
