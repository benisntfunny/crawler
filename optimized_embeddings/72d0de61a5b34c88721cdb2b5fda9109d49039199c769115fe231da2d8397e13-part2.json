The approval process starts with the seller’s registration that can be done by you or the seller.\n\nSeller Registration\nOnly registered users can access the features of the seller portal. You can manually register a seller, or the seller can register themselves through the seller portal. When a seller self-registers, they create a login with their name and email address. The seller can then complete the registration process at any time. You can track the seller’s registration and set up email notifications to follow the seller’s progress.\nRegister a Seller Portal User Manually\nYou can register a seller portal user manually by creating a contact, associating it with a seller account, and promoting the contact to a user.\nDeactivate a Seller Portal User\nDeactivating a user allows you to suspend their access to the Seller Portal and reclaim their Customer Community Plus license. Deactivation preserves the record of the user and gives you the option to reactivate them later.\nConfigure Seller's Self-Registration\nConfigure the self-registration capability for Commerce Marketplace sellers\nView a Seller’s Self-Registration Application\nYou can track a prospect’s progress in registering to be a seller on your marketplace and verify their eligibility.\nCustomize the Seller Approval Flow\nYou can customize the approval stages and apply different rules for approval.\nSet Up Seller Registration Status Emails\nYou can get email notifications regarding the seller’s registration status.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
