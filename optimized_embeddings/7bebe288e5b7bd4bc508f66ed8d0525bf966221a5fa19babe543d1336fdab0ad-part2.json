For each approval step involving a queue, add individual users as assigned approvers, so those individuals can receive the approval request notifications in the mobile app. To have both queues and individual users as assigned approvers, select Automatically assign to approver(s) instead of Automatically assign to queue in the approval step.\nNotifications for approval requests are sent only to users who have access to the record being approved. Assigned approvers who don’t have record access can receive email approval notifications, but they can’t complete the approval request until someone grants record access.\nApprovals in Chatter\n\nIn the Salesforce mobile app, you can’t respond to approval requests from Chatter. To respond to approval requests, go to the Approvals navigation item.\n\nApproval Comments\nThe Salesforce mobile app prompts you for comments after you tap Approve or Reject.\nThe Approval History related list displays truncated comments. To see the full comment for a given approval instance, tap the instance, then tap Comments.\nApproval History Related List\nThe Approval History related list doesn’t include the Submit for Approval button.\nWhen working with approvals in Experience Cloud sites, role-based external users can see and take action from the Approval History related list, but they can’t submit requests for approval.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
