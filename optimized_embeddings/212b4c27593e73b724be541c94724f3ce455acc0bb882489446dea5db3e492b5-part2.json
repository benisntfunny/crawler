Clone a sandbox to copy its data and metadata into another sandbox. Refresh an existing sandbox to update its contents.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Database.com Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo view a sandbox:\tView Setup and Configuration\nTo create, refresh, activate, and delete a sandbox:\tManage Dev Sandboxes (Developer or Developer Pro only) or Manage Sandboxes (all sandbox types)\n\nYou have a few ways to copy metadata and data to a sandbox. What data gets copied during creation and cloning depends on sandbox type.\n\nWhere Are Sandboxes Created?\n\nSandboxes are created on sandbox instances. The location of the sandbox instance depends on where it’s corresponding production org is located.\n\nSandboxes created from a production org in Salesforce First-Party are created on a Salesforce First-Party instance in the same region.\nSandboxes created from a production org in Hyperforce are created on a Hyperforce instance in the same country.\nSandboxes created from a production org in Government Cloud or Government Cloud Plus are created on a Government Cloud instance.\n\nIf a production org is migrated to a different infrastructure type (example: Salesforce First-Party to Hyperforce), new sandboxes created post-migration are also created on the new infrastructure type. Existing sandboxes remain on their current instance until they are refreshed or deleted by an admin, or migrated by Salesforce.\n\nDetermine Who Has Sandbox Access\nWhen a sandbox is created, all active users in the source org have access to the sandbox. Selective Sandbox Access helps you limit access to only required users and removes the additional step for a Salesforce admin to change user email addresses back to their original format. If you don’t want to match the access currently defined in the source org, you can create a public group to grant access to a subset of users.\nCreate a Sandbox\nWhen you create a sandbox, Salesforce copies the metadata from your production org to a sandbox org. What data gets copied depends on sandbox type.\nRefresh Your Sandbox\nRefreshing a sandbox updates its metadata from the source org. If the sandbox is a clone or if it uses a sandbox template, the refresh process updates the org’s data and its metadata. The org ID of the sandbox changes each time it’s refreshed.\nActivate Your Refreshed Sandbox\nIf you didn’t select Auto Activate while refreshing your sandbox, you must activate your sandbox before you can use it.\nWhat are Preview and Non-Preview Sandboxes?\nDuring the Salesforce major release transitions, sandboxes get upgraded on different timelines based on their release type. The two release types for sandboxes are preview and non-preview.\nSome Considerations\nReview these considerations when you create, refresh, or delete a sandbox.\nSandbox Cloning\nYou can create a sandbox by cloning an existing sandbox rather than using your production org as your source. Save time by customizing a sandbox with a set of data and metadata and then replicating it. Sandbox cloning simplifies having multiple concurrent streams of work in your application life cycle. You can set up a sandbox for each type of work, such as development, testing, and staging. Your colleagues can easily clone individual sandboxes instead of sharing one sandbox and avoid stepping on each other’s toes.\nMonitor Your Sandbox’s Progress\nFrom Setup, enter Sandboxes in the Quick Find box, then select Sandboxes. The list of your sandboxes displays a progress bar for items in the queue, in progress, or recently completed.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
