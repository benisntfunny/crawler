To get started faster, create a signup form campaign.\n\nFrom your marketing workspace, create or open a form.\nAdd or move components to create the layout that you want.\nNOTE If you leave the API Name field blank when you create a new form, Salesforce creates an API name for you. After you save the form, you can’t edit the API name.\nTo include fields that aren’t related to a Salesforce object field, use one of these input components: Checkbox, Dropdown, Email, Phone Number, or Plain Text.\nYou must manually enter the picklist options for dropdown components. There’s no mapping to picklist values in Salesforce Setup. Information captured from these types of form fields is stored in the Unified Customer Profile.\nTo include fields that relate to Salesforce records, configure a data source.\nYou can add or change data sources at any time.\nFrom the Fields tab, click Configure Data Source.\nGive your data source a name.\nSelect the Salesforce Record data type.\nSelect an object and a record type.\nSave the data source.\nDrag the object fields onto the canvas.\nDon’t change the API Name value of a field added from a data source. When visitors submit their information in these data source fields, the fields automatically map to record fields on the object that you selected, and a record of that type is created in Salesforce.\nIn the Form Submission section of the configuration panel, select what happens when a visitor submits the form.\nSave the form.\nRelate a flow to the form.\nTo autogenerate a preconfigured form submission flow, expand the Flow section and click Create a Flow.\nTo add an existing flow to the form, open Flow Builder and assign the form to a flow. Refresh the form to view the latest details.\nRelate the flow to a campaign.\nSave the form again.\nWhen you’re ready to publish the form, click Publish.\nNOTE Publishing a form activates the flow that’s associated with it.\n\nTo preview your form, save it, and then open the landing page that contains the form.\n\nData Sources for Forms in Marketing Cloud Growth\nA data source is a representation of a set of data that you can access and configure. It functions as a bridge between a form and the Salesforce object data in your org. Adding a data source to your form helps you capture user information in a Salesforce record after a visitor submits the form.\nUnpublish a Form in Marketing Cloud Growth\nRemove your customers’ access to a form by unpublishing it. Unpublishing a form also deactivates the flow that’s related to it. After deactivation, the flow finishes running, but it doesn’t capture any more user data. If a form is unpublished while a user is entering their information, that user’s data isn’t captured when they click Submit.\nProtect Forms with reCAPTCHA\nProtect your marketing landing pages with forms from bots, fraudulent activities, spam, and abuse with Google reCAPTCHA. The Google reCAPTCHA v2 integration is available only for marketing landing pages with forms. It doesn’t apply to LWR sites or other sites built from templates.\nConsiderations and Limitations for Forms on Marketing Cloud Growth Landing Pages\nWhen you’re working with a form on a landing page, keep these considerations and limitations in mind.\nSEE ALSO\nMarketing Cloud Growth Content Items and Statuses\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
