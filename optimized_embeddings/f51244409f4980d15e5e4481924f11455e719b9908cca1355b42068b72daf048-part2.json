These systems include your student information system (SIS) or learning management system (LMS). For example, show all of a support staff member's first-year students with an undeclared major, or all of a support staff member's students who are at risk.\nLearn About Cases List Views\n\nStudent Success Hub (SSH) provides both K-12 and higher ed orgs a list view that shows support staff a list of their student Cases.\n\nThe list view, My Students, includes all Cases that the support staff User owns and whose Status isn't Closed. Support staff can access this list by selecting Cases from the app navigation menu and choosing My Students from the list view menu.\n\nAdd the Email Mass Action Button to Cases List Views\n\nGive support staff the option to send an email to one or more students from Cases list views.\n\nBefore You Begin with Mass Actions\n\nBefore you add the mass action button, consider how mass actions work in SSH.\n\nMass actions on Cases list views are visible to all users.\n\nThe mass action button uses SSH terminology (Email Students).\n\nThe selected Cases must be Student Record Cases and their associated Contact records must have a valid email address. See Verify Email Deliverability.\n\nWhen a staff member sends an email, the From Email field appears blank unless the staff member has the View Setup and Configuration system permission. When the From Email field is blank, the email is sent from the staff member's User email address.\n\nSSH sends the email to each student individually. Students don't see other recipients in the To field.\n\nEmails that you send count against the 5,000 mass email limit. See Mass Email Limitations.\n\nAdd the Email Mass Action Button to Cases List Views\n\nAdd and test the email mass action button.\n\nAdd the email button.\n\nFrom Setup, in Object Manager, click Case.\n\nClick List View Button Layout.\n\nIn the List View row, click  and select Edit.\n\nAdd the Email Students custom button to the Selected Buttons list.\n\nSave your changes.\n\nGive the support staff profile access to the VisualForce Page that the email action opens.\n\nFrom Setup, search for and then select Profiles.\n\nClick the support staff profile.\n\nIn the Enabled Visualforce Page Access section, verify that the sfal.SendEmailMassAction item is enabled. If not, click Edit and add it to the Enabled Visualforce Pages list.\n\nSave your changes.\n\nVerify that the button is available in student Cases list views.\n\nLog in to the SSH app as a support staff member and choose Cases from the app navigation menu.\n\nSelect a Cases list view such as My Students.\n\nVerify that the Email Students button appears.\n\nTest the email button.\n\nSelect the checkbox next to one or more students and then click Email Students.\n\nWrite the email message and send the email.\n\nVerify that the selected students receive the email.\n\nConsider Creating Custom List Views of Students\n\nYou can use data imported from integration systems that connect to standard or custom Salesforce objects to create custom student Case list views. These systems include your student information system (SIS) or learning management system (LMS). For example, show all of a support staff member's first-year students with an undeclared major, or all of a support staff member's students who are at risk.\n\nBefore you create a custom student Case list view, you must make this data available to the student's Case record. Create rollup summary fields, formulas, or triggers to populate the data. These methods let you filter student list views using data that isn't directly available on the Case record.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
