However, your users can configure their own email settings. They control whether they want to receive emails, how often they receive them, and the types of changes that trigger notifications. It’s important that your users know how to control the amount of email they receive. Too many email notifications are a pain point for many Chatter users and a common barrier to adoption.\n\nConfigure general Chatter email settings and branding from Setup. Enter Email Settings in the Quick Find box, then select Email Settings. This table describes the settings.\n\nSETTING\tDESCRIPTION\nGeneral Settings\t\nAllow Emails\tEnables or disables email notifications for your entire company. If you deselect this option, all email notifications are disabled and your users don’t receive notifications.\nAllow Email Replies\tIf selected, users can reply to email notifications about messages and comments via email instead of navigating to the comment or message in Chatter.\nAllow Posts via Email\tIf selected, users can post to groups through email.\nAllow Attachments via Email\tIf selected, users can include attachments on posts to groups that are made through email.\nShow mobile app download badges\t\n\nShow App Store and Google Play download badges for Salesforce in all Chatter email notifications from your internal org.\n\nBadges don’t appear in email notifications from Experience Cloud sites. A recipient’s language setting affects whether badges appear: if a badge isn’t translated in the set language, it doesn’t appear in the email. The show badges option is selected by default.\n\n\nAllow API-only Chatter Digests\t\n\nThis setting appears only if API-only Chatter Digests are enabled for your company. To enable this feature, contact Salesforce.\n\nWhen you select this option, daily and weekly scheduled digests are disabled for your entire company. To provide digests to your users, you must call the API.\n\n\nSender\t\nFrom Name\tThe name that appears as the sender’s name in the email notification. Enter a name in this field if you want the sender name to contain a static value, such as your company’s name. If you leave this field blank, a dynamic name is used.\nEmail Address\t\n\nThe email address of the sender. For example, add your company’s email address. This field is required for Chatter email notifications to be sent.\n\nA few things to keep in mind:\n\nIf the Allow Email Replies setting isn’t selected, then replies sent via email go directly to this email address and don’t appear on the Chatter post.\nChatter email notifications are only sent from verified email addresses.\nDon’t use a distribution email list in this field. Verification emails are sent when this field is populated. If you use a distribution email list, verification emails are sent to everyone in that list.\n\nBranding\t\nLogo\tThe Chatter logo appears in the email notification by default. To keep your email notifications consistent with your company’s brand, upload your company logo and replace the default.\nFooter Text\tThe text that appears in the footer of the notification email. We strongly recommend including your company’s physical address to comply with applicable anti-spam laws.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
