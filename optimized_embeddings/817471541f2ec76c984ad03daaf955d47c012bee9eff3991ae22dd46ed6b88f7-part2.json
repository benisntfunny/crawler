You can publish a module or trail only if it’s added to a release. Before you start lining up your planned releases, review some important guidelines about how releases work in Trailmaker.\nCreate a Release in Trailmaker Release\nYou can add modules and trails to an unpublished release even if you haven’t yet created the content in Trailmaker Content. You also can create the release and wait for writers to add their content to the release from Trailmaker Content.\nChange the Status of an Unpublished Release\nThe content collection page in Trailmaker Release lists the content collection’s unpublished releases, published releases, and published content. If a release hasn’t been published yet, you can change its status while your team gets ready.\nAdd Items to a Release from Trailmaker Release\nYou can add one or more items to a release from Trailmaker Release. Manually add items one at a time, or upload a CSV file that includes the full list of changes to process in the release. You can include up to 1,000 items in a release.\nDelete Content from a Release with Trailmaker Release\nYou can delete content from an unpublished release.\nUpsert Content with Trailmaker Release\nWhen you add or update content, use the upsert operation, which updates and inserts the content.\nArchive Content with Trailmaker Release\nYou can remove published content from your enablement site by archiving it, which hides the content from learners but doesn’t delete it. You can later restore archived content.\nRestore Archived Content with Trailmaker Release\nYou can restore hidden content that you previously archived on your enablement site.\nMigrate Published Content to a Different Content Collection\nYou can move your company’s existing learning content from one content collection to another. For example, maybe your company previously published content under your enablement site’s single namespace before multiple content collections became available. And now, you want to move content to a content collection for a specific audience.\nPreview a Release in Trailmaker Release\nYour content stakeholders can preview all the new or changed trails and modules that you plan to publish in a release. The full release preview shows new or changed content in the context of all published content in your company’s enablement site. Only users with the appropriate permission can access the full release preview.\nCheck Your Release’s Health\nTrailmaker Release indicates whether a release is ready to publish or has issues that can prevent publishing.\nPublish Content with Trailmaker Release\nAfter you test, proofread, and validate your content, you can publish the release's new or changed content to your enablement site.\nDownload a Backpack from Trailmaker Release\nFrom Trailmaker Release, you can download the backpack ZIP file for a module or trail published in your company’s enablement site. With this backpack, your content creators can easily access the latest released version of content the next time they want to update it.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
