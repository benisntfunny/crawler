A work item captures a logical unit of work, such as a user story, task, or bug. Work items are organized by project and belong to the project where you created them.\n\nInformation in a work item includes:\n\nID\nAn automatically generated unique identifier that has a WI- prefix (for example, WI-12345). The ID helps DevOps Center users differentiate between similar-sounding work items. It’s also used in the project repository to identify the feature branch where changes for this work item are stored.\nSubject\nRequired. A brief description of the task to be tracked.\nDescription\nA more detailed description of the task to be tracked. If the work item is a bug, include an example of the problem to be solved. If the work item is a user story, include a hypothetical description of how the new functionality would benefit users.\nIt’s a good idea to include acceptance criteria that identifies what the successful completion of this work would look like. Make sure the person assigned this work item knows what’s required or you could lose time to iterations that could have been avoided.\nAssigned To\nDevOps Center user currently responsible for the completion of the task or objective tracked by this work item.\n\nA team or release manager can create work items as needed to capture the complete scope of the project.\n\nFrom Work Items, click New Work Item.\nEnter a descriptive subject.\nUse the Description field to provide information about the scope of work, acceptance criteria, and so on.\n(Optional) Assign the work item to a team member.\nClick Save.\n\nThe work item is displayed in the Work Items list.\n\nRepeat this procedure to track and assign project work. All DevOps Center users can create additional work items as the project progresses.\n\nWhen a team member is ready to begin work on a work item, they choose how they’re going to perform the work:\n\nDevelop and commit changes using a connected development environment (developer sandbox or scratch org)\nDevelop and commit changes to a work item feature branch outside of DevOps Center (using their favorite IDE or other development tools)\nWork in a Connected Dev Environment\nWhen you choose to work in a connected development environment, you perform much of your development and configuration tasks directly in a Developer or Developer Pro sandbox with source tracking enabled. We also support scratch orgs, which have source tracking enabled by default.\nWork Outside of DevOps Center\nAfter a work item is created, you can choose to do your development work entirely outside DevOps Center (without connecting to a development environment). After changes are merged in the source control system, the promotion is completed in DevOps Center or by using Salesforce CLI.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
