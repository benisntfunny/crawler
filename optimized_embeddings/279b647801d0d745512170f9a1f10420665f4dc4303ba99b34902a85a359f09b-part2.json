Specifically, the opportunity history must show at least one update in each of the past 12 months.\nYou must use a standard fiscal year. Standard fiscal years follow the Gregorian calendar, but can start on the first day of any month of the year.\nForecasts must be measured by opportunity revenue. Predictions are generated for only the oldest activated opportunity revenue forecast type.\nYour forecast hierarchy must include at least one forecasting enabled user who reports to a forecast manager.\nThe Amount field should be populated in at least 80 percent of open opportunities.\nOpportunity splits aren’t supported. The forecast predictions are based on total revenue, not shared revenue.\nYou must use the standard Opportunity object and the standard Close Date and Amount fields. Custom date fields aren’t supported.\nTo view the prediction graph on the home page when Einstein Forecasting is enabled, you must enable historical trending for Forecasting Item.\nYou can use Einstein Forecasting only in production orgs, not sandboxes.\nAvoid setting field-level security on the Sales Insights Integration User Profile for opportunity fields that you want to use to optimize your predictions. It can impact your forecasting accuracy.\nIf you plan to use field filters to segment your opportunities, be aware of what happens when you delete or deactivate picklist field values.\nIf you delete a picklist value from a standard field, you can’t use the value to set up a field filter.\nIf you deactivate a picklist value from a standard field, you can’t use it to set up a field filter. However, existing field filters based on that value still work with opportunity records that contain the deactivated value.\nIf you create a field filter using a standard field value and then delete the filtered value from the field, the filter still functions, but appears in Setup with a blank value.\nIf you delete a picklist value from a custom field, it still appears in Setup, but any filter created with that value doesn’t function.\nIf you deactivate a picklist value from a custom field, it can still be used to set up a field filter.\nSEE ALSO\nEinstein Forecasting\nEnable Einstein Forecasting\nUnderstand How Einstein Creates Your Forecasting Prediction\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
