Organizations across the world are required to comply with regulations that help to ascertain the customer’s identity and provide protection from losses and fraud. Failure to follow these regulations has legal consequences. Organizations must ensure that any person who seeks confidential information must first prove their identity and access.\n\nThe details a person must provide to prove their identity depends on the business. For example, the customer service representative (CSR) or contact center agent (CCA) can ask the person to confirm the social security number, birth date, insurance details, or driver’s license number.\n\nThe person contacting the call center can be a genuine customer, a parent or guardian of a minor customer, or an authorized representative of a customer. If a caller wants sensitive information, an agent must verify the caller’s identity first.\n\nTo use the Identity Verification feature, customize the identity verification process to meet your specific business and legal requirements. Learn more about the Identity Verification flow templates so that you can configure the verification page components based on your business requirements.\n\nComponents of Identity Verification\nIdentity verification relies on identity verification objects and identity verification flows. Identity verification also needs one of the three objects—Engagement Interaction, Messaging Session, or Voice Call—along with the Engagement Attendee and Engagement Topic objects.\nHow Identity Verification Works\nHow a CSR or CCA verifies a customer or their representative’s identity depends on the identity verification flow template that’s used to configure the process. Sometimes you’re required to verify only a caller or a customer’s identity. Or, if someone is seeking information on another person’s behalf, you’re required to verify both identities. In addition, some identity verification flows store interaction details. Your identity verification flow can also store interaction details. If someone is calling on another person’s behalf, verify both identities.\nDefine the Link Between Identity Verification Process Configuration and Flow\nThe Identity Verification Process Definition object links the identity verification process configuration to the identity verification flow. It also defines the layout of the search screen. To pass the configuration information to the flow, create a process definition record.\nSet Up Search and the Minimum Number of Additional Verifiers for Identity Verification\nWhen someone contacts a customer service representative (CSR) or a contact center agent (CCA) with a request, the CSR or CCA first searches for the person. To set up how the search works, create an identity verification process detail record. You can also specify the minimum number of additional verifying questions to ask.\nSet Up Fields for Search and Verification\nThe Identity Verification Process Field object enables you to determine what a CSR or CCA sees, such as which fields appear in search results or which fields must be verified. Create an Identity Verification Process Field record for each field that is part of your identity verification process.\nCreate an Identity Verification Flow\nCreate a flow using the Verify Caller Identity, the Verify Customer Identity V2, or the Verify Customer Identity Base V2 flow template.\nMake the Identity Verification Flow Available to Users\nTo enable your users to perform identity verification, make the flow available to them.\nDisable Automatic Creation of Attendees\nWhen a customer initiates an engagement with a CSR or CCA, an engagement attendee record that contains the name of the internal attendee—CSR or CCA—is automatically created. You can disable this automatic creation of internal attendees by turning off Auto-creation of Internal Attendee Record.\nEnable Users to Track the Progress of Engagement Interactions Visually\nUse Path Assistant to create paths to guide your users through the steps of a business process, such as working on an engagement interaction from initiation to successful resolution. Simply configure a path assistant on the Engagement Interaction object and then add the Path component to the Engagement Interaction record page.\nEngagement Interaction Record Sharing and Ownership\nUse the Sharing Settings page to manage your organization-wide sharing defaults for Engagement Interaction. Manage user access to engagement interactions using role hierarchies. Facilitate prioritization and assignment of engagement interactions using queues.\nUse External Data for Identity Verification\nIf the data required to verify a caller resides outside of Salesforce, configure the identity verification process to use data from an external source.\nIdentity Verification Flows\nThe flow templates for identity verification are designed to help organizations obey regulations that protect sensitive information.\nFlow Screen Input Component: Display Search Results\nDisplay the results of searches for callers and customers to the CSR or CCA. The component appears in the Verify Customer Identity V2 and the Verify Linked Customer Identity V2 flow templates.\nFlow Screen Input Component: Display Verification Results\nDisplay a message to a CSR or CCA indicating that verification was successful. The component appears in the Verify Customer Identity V2 and the Verify Linked Customer Identity V2 flow templates.\nFlow Screen Input Component: Search for Customer\nEnable users to search Salesforce or an external data source for callers and customers as part of the identity verification process. The component appears in the Verify Customer Identity V2 and the Verify Linked Customer Identity V2 flow templates.\nInvocable Actions\nLearn about the object-level access that's required for using invocable actions.\nPrevent Theft of Confidential Data\nOrganizations must comply with regulations that govern sensitive information. Failure to comply can have serious legal consequences. As a customer service representative (CSR) or contact center agent (CCA), it’s important to verify a customer’s identity before giving out the information that they seek.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
