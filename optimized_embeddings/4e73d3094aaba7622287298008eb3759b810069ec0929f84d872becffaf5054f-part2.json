See files displayed in a grid or switch to the familiar list view. Click a library or folder to see files displayed as thumbnails. A thumbnail view is an easy way to find files. With the Libraries component, you can sort files and pinpoint exactly what you’re looking for in no time at all.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\n\nTo use a guided setup, go to Experience Workspaces | Guided Setup, and select Intelligent Sales Enablement. Click Guided Setup.\n\nEnable the Library Component\nSet up libraries to upload, share, and manage files. You need Salesforce administrator permissions to enable the Libraries component.\nAdd Library Members\nYou can add members to libraries. Permissions are customizable from the library level, which gives you control over who can access files.\nCreate Library Folders\nCreating folders gives you more control over the content in your libraries. You can organize folders and subfolders in a way that makes sense to you.\nAdd Files to a Library\nAfter you have your folder structure set up, you can add files to your folders.\nEnable Content Deliveries and Public Links\nUse Content deliveries and public links to send links to files to people inside or outside your organization.\nManage Libraries from Files Home\nWorking in libraries is simpler now that admins can change libraries in Lightning Experience and manage libraries from Files Home.\nManage Library Membership from Files Home\nLibrary admins can update, add, delete, and track library members from Files Home. In the Current Members section, external users automatically get an “external badge” to help you identify external partners, customer site members, and portal and Chatter users.\nCustomize Experience Builder Site Libraries with Images\nGive each library a unique look by branding it with an image.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
