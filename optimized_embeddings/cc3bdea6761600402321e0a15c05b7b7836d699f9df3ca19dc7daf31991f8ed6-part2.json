Check out big-picture metrics, like prediction quality and top predictors. Drill in on details, such as impact, correlation, and weight of each predictor.\n\nOverview Page\n\nThe Overview page shows the overall prediction quality, the top-five predictors in the model, and some basic information about your prediction. Depending on the prediction quality, you can decide how to use your prediction based on this information alone. If not, review the other pages in the scorecard to get a closer look.\n\nThe Last Updated status shows the date and time your predictive model looked at the example data that was used to build your prediction. Einstein retrains your model once a month, as long as the prediction is enabled.\n\nPredictors Page\n\nThe Predictors page of the scorecard shows the impact of each predictor in your model. To see their impact, select a field included in your model.\n\nDetails Page\n\nThe Details page lists the fields that affect your prediction, with multiple metrics to indicate how meaningful they are. If your predictive model contains more than 100 predictors, it’s possible that you don’t see them all. The scorecard shows you the top 100 predictors ranked by impact, and the top 100 ranked by correlation. If your model has at least 100 predictors, the number displayed in the scorecard is likely to be from 100 through 200.\n\nImpact is a number from 0 through 1 that represents the scaled weight or importance of a predictor.\nCorrelation is the relationship, positive or negative, between a predictor and the field being predicted.\nImportance and Weight indicate the significance of a predictor. Depending on the model type used to build the prediction, either importance or weight is displayed, but not both.\nNOTE Data scientists know and care that importance is used when the model type is Random Forest, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regression, or Decision Tree Regression. Weight is used when the model type is Logistic Regression or Linear Regression.\n\nEinstein determines which predictive model type to use based on the type of prediction problem. See Predictive Model Types for more information.\n\nSettings Page\n\nThe Settings page summarizes everything selected when setting up the prediction. If you want to change anything, you can edit or clone your prediction and build again.\n\nEstimated Prediction Results\nSometimes prediction scorecards show Estimated in two places: the Prediction Quality and Distribution of Results.\nImprove the Quality of Yes/No Predictions\nWhen reviewing your prediction scorecard, you see a prediction score. If you’re not satisfied, here are some ways to improve the prediction quality.\nImprove the Quality of Numeric Predictions (Beta)\nWhen reviewing your prediction’s scorecard, you get a prediction quality score. If you’re not satisfied with the quality, here are some steps you can take to try to improve it.\nPredictive Model Types\nYour prediction’s scorecard shows the predictive model type that was used to build your prediction. Einstein Prediction Builder tests multiple predictive models and chooses the one that performs best based on your data. The models we test depend on the type of field that you’re predicting.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
