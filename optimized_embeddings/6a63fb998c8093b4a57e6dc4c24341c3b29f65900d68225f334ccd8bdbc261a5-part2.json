Perfectly understandable. Diving into a redesigned app can be disorienting—especially when you’re able to work in the original interface with your eyes closed. To hone your Lightning Experience chops, let’s look at where some of the most common Salesforce features landed in the new interface.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nFind Profile and Personal Settings in Lightning Experience\nIn Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience, use your profile menu to access your profile page and personal settings. If you have permission to switch between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, the link to do so is located here, too.\nFind Objects and Apps in Lightning Experience\nIt’s easier to find your objects and apps in Lightning Experience than in Salesforce Classic. Compare the two interfaces to see for yourself.\nFind Your Way Around List Views in Lightning Experience\nLightning Experience improves the Salesforce Classic list view experience with a more intuitive layout, convenient navigation, and integrated list creation and editing.\nFind Your Way Around Records in Lightning Experience\nIn Salesforce Classic, record details, related lists, and the record feed display on the same page. In Lightning Experience, the way information is organized on record pages is highly configurable. There are two default record page views: Full view, for an experience that’s similar to Salesforce Classic, and Grouped view, where information is balanced out across different tabs and columns.\nFind Recently Viewed Items in Lightning Experience\nYou can access items that you recently viewed quickly in Lightning Experience in more ways than Salesforce Classic.\nFind Actions and Buttons in Lightning Experience\nSalesforce Classic displays actions in the Chatter publisher, and buttons on a record’s details page. Lightning Experience blurs the distinction between these elements. It intermingles actions and buttons, locating them in different areas based on function.\nFind Your Way Around Related Lists in Lightning Experience\nRecords in Salesforce include details and links to other related records. Salesforce Classic displays related records in lists that appear at the bottom of the page. In Lightning Experience, related information appears in condensed related list cards that are easier to access.\nFind Your Way Around Chatter in Lightning Experience\nWith Lightning Experience, you can securely connect with people and groups and share business information, just like you’re used to in Salesforce Classic. The way you access Chatter feeds, groups, and profiles is a bit different in the new interface. But with this quick overview, we hope you feel right at home.\nFind Your Way Around Setup in Lightning Experience\nLightning Experience Setup makes it faster and easier than ever to customize Salesforce to meet your company’s needs.\nFind Help in Lightning Experience\nWith Learning Paths, your admin assigns learning content to help you get your work done. See links to these learning items in the Guidance Center from anywhere in the app or in Learning Home. Admins see curated checklists with suggested steps and guidance for setup.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
