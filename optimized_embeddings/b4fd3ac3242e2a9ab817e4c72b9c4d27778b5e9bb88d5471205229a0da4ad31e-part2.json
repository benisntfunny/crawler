Each purchase made on the storefront by a shopper generates a Seller Order containing product items and shipment type. In addition to the fields that appear in the Marketplace Order canvas, the Seller Order canvas also displays a timeline for tracking the status of the order. This timeline gives the seller a quick view of the order status and allows them to change the status by using the Mark Status Timeline as Complete action.\n\nAnother quick action that can be used by the seller before the order has been invoiced is Confirm Order. With this quick action, the seller can Cancel Order and Confirm Full Order. The seller can also Confirm Partial Order when there’s an unavailable quantity of products. If that happens, the seller must update the order by creating Canceled Items records and updating Line Items records.\n\nCustomize Seller Order Status\n\nThe Seller Order Status can be customized to create values for the OMS Status field and use the configuration object.\n\nObjects Related to the Seller Order\n\nLine Item Object\n\nEach Stock Keeping Unit entered in the Seller Order generates a Line Item. The Line Item is aimed at storing the SKU, the quantity, and price of each product entered in the Seller Order. But the object still contains additional information such as different types of commission, which provide a high level of detail within the order and provide price information for the product to which the commission rule will be applied.\n\nSeller Shipment Object\n\nThe Seller Shipment object is aimed at storing the Seller Order delivery information such as address, delivery method, and delivery value. It can also store additional information, such as URLs for order tracking or URLs for receipt attachments. Currently, the marketplace operator can only select one delivery method per Seller Order. This restriction means that only one Seller Shipment is linked to each Seller Order. It’s possible to use another object in the Salesforce Commerce Cloud to guarantee more than one delivery method per Seller Order, but such customization must be set up during project implementation.\n\nCanceled Items Object\n\nWhen a product that is unavailable is canceled by the shopper from a Seller Order, records are created for each canceled product within the Canceled Items object. Besides creating Canceled Items records, the Line Items object is also updated and the new information is sent to B2C Commerce via integration. If the marketplace operator wants to create a trigger to update the reimbursement of a canceled item via gateway, they must request this setup to be done during the implementation of the project.\n\nRecalculation of the Commission\n\nThe recalculation of the commission is another factor the seller and the marketplace operator must consider when a Canceled Item is generated. The commission values are duly updated from the new value of the Line Item after the cancellation of items. But if the item cancellation is made by the seller or the marketplace operator on behalf of the shopper, they must manually create a Canceled Item record. When the creation of a Canceled Item is done, the related Line Item object is updated. But the whole returns process for the item that the shopper wants to return must be done via Customer Service or another manual process on the Marketplace.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
