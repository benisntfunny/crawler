They can perform these actions regardless of whether they have the Manage Unlisted Groups permission.\nYou can’t grant the Manage Unlisted Groups permission to users with these profiles: Chatter External, High Volume Portal, or High Volume Customer Portal.\nUnlisted groups count toward a user’s group limit. Even so, unlisted groups don’t appear in the Groups list on a user’s profile unless the person who’s viewing the list is a member or has permission to manage unlisted groups. When unlisted groups are hidden, the count that appears next to the Groups list can be inaccurate, depending on the permissions of the person viewing the list.\nFor Developers\n\nApex code runs in system mode, which means that the permissions of the current user aren’t taken into account. This limitation has implications for pages that are written in Apex.\n\nVisualforce pages that display groups can expose unlisted groups to users who aren’t members.\nBecause system mode disregards the user’s permissions, all users who are accessing a Visualforce page that’s showing an unlisted group can act as an owner of that group.\nAppExchange apps that are written in Apex and that access all groups expose unlisted groups to users who aren’t members.\n\nTo limit and manage access to the unlisted groups in your organization:\n\nIn all Apex code, explicitly filter out unlisted groups from SOQL queries.\nUse permission sets, profile-level permissions, and sharing checks in your code to further limit unlisted group access.\nTo monitor and manage the creation of unlisted groups, use Apex triggers on the CollaborationGroup object. In Setup, enter Group Triggers in the Quick Find box, then select Group Triggers to add triggers.\nSEE ALSO\nEnable Unlisted Chatter Groups\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
