Whether it’s stocking shelves or responding to questions, managing your business is an all-consuming task. With Essentials, you can bring email, tasks, and all your other to-dos right into Salesforce. Here are our top recommendations for getting the most out of Essentials.\n\nBring Your Emails into Essentials, Automatically.\n\nIf you’re ever frustrated when you’re trying to look at multiple tabs to write a single email, have we got news for you. All of that can be viewed on a single screen with Essentials. With Einstein Activity Capture, your emails and events are automatically brought into Salesforce. That means you see contact information for each customer, how they last interacted with your business, and any other relevant info on a single page. The best part about it? Once you set it up, you’ll never have to juggle all those sheets, documents, and tabs again.\n\nCreate One Giant Database.\n\nEvery time a customer comes into your shop, looks at a property, or inquires about your services is a great opportunity to get contact information for your next email campaign or promotion, right? Storing their information in the Contacts object makes it easy for you to find their info or see any interaction they’ve had with your business. And don’t forget, you’ll see all emails related to that contact thanks to Einstein Activity Capture.\n\nNOTE The Contacts object includes an Account field that you’ll need to fill out. Use a dummy name like CustomerAccount to fill in this field for individual customers. Then you’ll be able to sort by that dummy name in both the Contacts and Accounts objects.\nTurn Customer Questions into Cases.\n\nIf you’re working with customers on a regular basis, then you know that customers love to ask questions. Queries about sizing, contracts, hours of operation and more. You may not have support agents waiting to tend to their every need, but you do have cases! With Email-2-Case and Web-2-Case, customer emails or submissions from your company’s website are automatically turned into cases and brought right into Essentials. Then you can sort or rank them to make sure that top priority cases get your attention ASAP.\n\nSet Reminders and Create Tasks to Level Up Your Customer Experience.\n\nEver get a coupon for your birthday that causes you to go out for some retail therapy? What about nudge every few months that your teeth need a cleaning? These timely, helpful reminders keep business coming back to you and let customers know you care about them. Let Essentials remind you when it’s time to follow up or send that annual birthday email to keep customers coming back for more.\n\nSEE ALSO\nUse Einstein Activity Capture\nSync Emails and Activities\nTurn Emails and Social Media Posts into Cases\nTasks\nEvents and Calendars\nActivity Reminders and Notifications\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
