When an unpublished brand is attached to an email or landing page, and you publish the content, the brand is also published. To protect your company’s brand values from unauthorized changes, establish an approval process for creating, updating, and publishing brand styles.\n\nMobile-specific brand settings apply only to landing pages. They don’t apply to emails.\n\nCreate and Publish a Brand in Marketing Cloud Growth\n\nEach brand that you create is stored in your content workspace and is available for marketers to select when they create content. If you save your brand in a workspace that’s shared with another workspace, you can apply the brand to an email or landing page in the shared workspace.\n\nFrom your marketing workspace, click Add.\nSelect Content | Brand, and then click Create.\nGive your brand a title and specify your company’s colors and other styles. Optionally, further customize the colors for your button styles.\nAs you adjust the brand values, your style changes appear in the preview panel.
