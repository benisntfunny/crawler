Before June 10, these MuleSoft customers should continue to use the MuleSoft Help Center to open and manage support cases.\n\nResolution\nCreate a Case on Salesforce Help\n\nFrom June 10, 2024, all MuleSoft customers can create and manage cases on the Salesforce Help portal.  \n\nNote for customers migrating from the MuleSoft legacy support plan: A limited number of previously closed cases and all open cases have been migrated to Salesforce Help. These cases should be managed through the Salesforce Help portal. To view cases that were not migrated, see the section below, Logging in to MuleSoft Help Portal to Manage Old Cases. \n\nFollow these steps to prepare your Trailblazer account, log in to the Salesforce Help portal, submit a Support case, and escalate a case.\n\nTrailblazer Account Setup for Salesforce Help Page\nOption 1: Use your Existing Trailblazer Account to Connect your MuleSoft Anypoint account\n\nIf you already use Salesforce Help for product support or Trailhead, you already have a Trailblazer profile, and there is no need to set up a new Trailblazer account.\n\nFrom your Trailblazer profile, visit the settings page https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazer/settings.\n\nSelect Connected Accounts in the left navigation then Connect an Account.\n \n\nSelect Continue with MuleSoft and authenticate yourself. This will connect your MuleSoft Anypoint login to your Trailblazer account.\n\nThat’s it, you now have your MuleSoft account connected to your Trailblazer Account.\n\n \n\nOption 2: Create a Trailblazer Account using your MuleSoft Anypoint Account\n\nIf you don't have a Trailblazer account, you can create a Trailblazer account by using your MuleSoft account: \n\nVisit Salesforce Help Portal.\n\nClick “Login” in the upper right corner of the screen.\n\nSelect Trailblazer Account.\n \n\nSelect Continue with MuleSoft and enter your MuleSoft Anypoint account information.\n \n\nFollow the remaining prompts to complete your Trailblazer profile.\n\nOption 3: Create a Trailblazer Account using your MuleSoft Email\n\nIf you don't have a Trailblazer profile, you can create a Trailblazer account by using the email address associated with your MuleSoft account by following the below steps: \n\nVisit Salesforce Help Portal.\n\nClick “Login” in the upper right corner of the screen.\n\nSelect Trailblazer Account.\n \n\nSelect Email and enter the email address associated with your MuleSoft account.\n \n\nFollow the remaining prompts to complete your Trailblazer profile\n\nSalesforce Help Portal\nLogging in to Salesforce Help Portal Using Trailblazer\n\nSigning up or logging in to Trailblazer account with an email address means that you never set a password. Instead, you verify your identity with a single-use code sent to your email address. Let’s walk through the steps for using a single-use code.\n\nVisit Salesforce Help Portal.\n\nClick “Login” in the upper right corner of the screen.\n\nSelect Trailblazer Account.\n\n\nUse the Email field to enter your email address. Trailblazer will send a single-use code to that address.\n\nUsing a new tab or browser window, open your email account. Retrieve the single-use code.\n\nReturn to the Trailblazer. Enter Your Single-Use Code screen and enter the code.  \n\nThat’s all there is to it—you’re logged in!\n\nNotes:\n\nIf you can't access the email account that is associated with your Trailblazer account to get the single-use code, and you have no other login method available, contact Customer Support. After you're back in, add another login method to your account on the Trailblazer Settings page so you don't get locked out again.\n\nTo stop getting the single-use code from your email every time you log in, go to your Settings page and add a login method other than email. It can be a Salesforce, Google, or LinkedIn login. Then, use that login method instead of email. You can also log in with your MuleSoft account directly without the single-use code.\n\nIf you have multiple MuleSoft accounts using different email addresses, you may be prompted to log in again using your alternate email address, before submitting a case. \n\nTo keep your account secure, Trailbazer prompts you to verify any unverified email addresses or socials.\n\nIf you see a prompt to verify them when logging in, or from your Trailblazer.me account settings page, there are some possible reasons.\n\nYou logged in with a social or Salesforce account that has an unverified email address.\n\nWhen you logged in, we found other accounts that we think you own and are asking you to verify them.\n\n  \nHow to Submit a Support Case on the Salesforce Help Portal\n\n\n\n \n\nLog in to Salesforce Help Portal.\n\nClick Contact Support and select Create a Case.\n\n\nFill out the case submission form. Select MuleSoft for Product and choose the best match for Topic.  \nNote: The Support Portal will generate recommendations for the product based on the subject or description entered.  Please confirm that the correct product, \"MuleSoft\", is selected before submitting your case.\n\nTip: If you have multiple Orgs, once you're on the 'Manage All Orgs' page, double-check that you're selecting the correct Org to create your case for support. One way to validate your Org is to check the Support Level anticipated. For instance, Orgs with \"SigMS\" will be handled as MuleSoft Signature, and Orgs with \"PremMS\" will be handled as MuleSoft Premier. The Product for the tenant you select should also be a MuleSoft product; Anypoint, RPA, or Composer. \n \n\nHow to Escalate a Case on the Salesforce Help Portal\n\nClick “My Cases,” to show a list of open cases.\n\n\n\nBy clicking case details to view a case, you can then click the “I need help button” to escalate the case. \n\n \n\nNote: For the Premier and Signature Plan (all severity levels), the escalate button appears as soon as the case is created. For Titanium customers the escalate button will appear once the initial response time milestone has passed. The initial response time is based on the severity level of the case. If the Escalate Case button isn't available, add a comment to the case requesting the case to be expedited. \nManage Open Cases on MuleSoft Help\n\nFrom June 10, 2024, all MuleSoft customers will be migrated to Salesforce Help and should log new cases via the Salesforce Help portal. All open cases and a limited number of closed cases will be migrated to Salesforce Help. Previously logged closed cases that are not migrated to Salesforce Help can be viewed  by logging into the MuleSoft Help portal.\n\nLogging in to MuleSoft Help Portal to Manage Old Cases  \n\nNavigate to the Support Cases page on the Mulesoft Help portal and sign in.  \n\nNote: You can also access the old support cases from the Salesforce Help portal by using the 'My Cases' dropdown and selecting My Legacy MuleSoft Cases.\n\nClick the Support cases tile to view your existing cases that have been reported.\n\n\n  \n\nNote: Migrated  customers who accidentally try to open cases in the MuleSoft Help Center will be redirected to the Salesforce Help for support and cases.\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nHow to create a MuleSoft Automation Support Case (MuleSoft Composer for Salesforce & MuleSoft RPA for Salesforce customers)\n\nKnowledge Article Number\n\n000394257\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
