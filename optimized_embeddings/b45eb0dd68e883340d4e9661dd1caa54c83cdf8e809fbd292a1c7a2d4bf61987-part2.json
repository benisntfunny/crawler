Conflicts can take different forms, and DevOps Center provides functionality to help you identify potential conflicts early and resolve them.\n\nHere are some common types of conflicts.\n\nMultiple Work Items That Modify the Same Source File\n\nIf you have multiple work items that modify the same source file (particularly in cases where multiple developers are touching the same metadata components in their own respective development environments), the changes can conflict or potentially overwrite each other when they’re merged into the first integrated pipeline stage. During the promotion process, DevOps Center warns you about the potential conflict. In some cases, the source control repository doesn’t know how to reconcile the changes to the same metadata component. Sometimes the promotion is blocked based on a dependency with a shared component.\n\nWhen DevOps Center detects a potential conflict due to work items that share components or contain dependencies, it provides you with the option to combine the work items so you can continue with the promotion. If you don’t choose to combine the affected work items, you can choose to further analyze the potential conflict and fix it manually, or promote the dependent work item first.\n\nUnresolvable Merge Conflict in Two Branches\n\nWhen a work item is promoted from one stage to the next, the source files contained in the work item are merged from the first stage’s source control branch to the next stage’s source control branch. The source control system, GitHub, helps to determine if the changes are mergeable before you attempt to promote them. If GitHub detects a conflict, the promotion is blocked.\n\nYou can see more information on the merge conflict in the error dialog in the Activity History, and you can view additional details of the conflict in the pull request in the source control system. You can resolve the conflict manually directly in the source control system, and then you can attempt the promotion in DevOps Center.\n\nYour Component Version Is Different from Merged Component\n\nWhen you have a stage that contains multiple work items that contain the same component, the stage contains a merged version of the component. If you then choose to promote only one of those work items from the stage to the next stage, it’s possible that the version of the component that you promote is different from the merged component that was tested. DevOps Center warns you when this situation occurs and provides you the option to combine the changes using the latest version. We recommend that you promote all work items that contain the common component together, so that the next stage contains the same merged version of the component as what was tested in the previous stage.\n\nPrevent Potential Conflicts By Combining Work Items\nPrevent potential conflicts during the promotion process by combining work items that share metadata components. In some cases, the source control repository doesn’t know how to reconcile the changes to the same metadata component. Sometimes the promotion is blocked based on a dependency with a shared component. But have no fear, DevOps Center detects the shared components and provides you with a way to promote your changes through the release pipeline with confidence.\nMerge Conflicts in GitHub\nMerge conflicts can occur when multiple work items contain one or more of the same components, especially when multiple developers are making changes that impact the same components in different development environments. DevOps Center warns you about potential merge conflicts so you can investigate to ensure that you don’t inadvertently overwrite desired changes.\nReview and Resolve Conflicts in GitHub\nIn cases where DevOps Center can’t combine work items or you choose not to combine, DevOps Center blocks the promotion. In this case, you manually edit the files directly in GitHub to resolve the conflict in the affected branch.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
