The API name is auto-populated based on the name that you enter. You can’t change the name and API name after you save your definition for the first time.\nDescription\tEnter a description of your definition.\nProcess Type\t\n\nSelect a process type based on the licenses available in your Salesforce org. Data Processing Engine can process data differently based on the rules set by the license. Process types ensure that definitions follow the validations and limits of the associated license. Process types can also provide exclusive capabilities. Process types are available for these licenses:\n\nLoyalty Management\nRebate Management\nFinancial Services Cloud\nManufacturing Cloud\nNet Zero Cloud\n\nTo run the definition without any rules associated with a license, select the process type as Standard.\n\n\nUse this data processing engine as a template?\tTo create a read-only definition, select this option. Your colleagues and partners can make a copy of the template definitions and change them based on their business requirements.\nAfter you enter the definition details, click Next.\nSelect one of these runtime platforms:\nCRM Analytics: Select to use CRM Analytics to transform your data or if the data is from a CRM Analytics dataset.\nData Cloud: Select to use Data Cloud to transform your data or if the data is from Data Model Objects (DMO), Data Lake Objects (DLO), or Calculated Insights Objects (CIO). In the Data Space menu, select the data space to use objects within that data space in the definition.\nFor more information about runtimes, see Data Processing Engine Runtimes.\nClick Done.\n\nThe definition is created. These steps show a brief workflow of how you typically set up and run a definition:\n\nCreate Data Source nodes.\nCreate input variables.\nThis option is only available with the CRM Analytics runtime.\nCreate the required nodes in the sequence to be processed.\nCreate a separate Writeback Objects node for each object or Analytics dataset that you want to write the results back to.\nSave the definition.\nActivate the definition.\nValidate the definition to make sure that it’s correct and can be run. Any errors in the definition are highlighted when you try to activate a definition. Warnings are also provided. Warnings help you identify issues that you can choose to fix or ignore.\n\nAfter you activate the definition, it’s available to run in Flows or from the definition's builder.\n\nCreate a Data Processing Engine Node\nAdd a node to your Data Processing Engine definition to transform data. Each node type transforms your data in a different way. For example, you can use a node to join two datasets, calculate a field value using formulas, or append a dataset to another dataset.\nConfigure a Data Processing Engine Node\nConfigure nodes in a definition to set up how data is transformed.\nCreate or Edit a Data Processing Engine Definition in a JSON File\nBuild a Data Processing Engine definition in a JSON file and then upload it to the builder. You can also download definitions, make changes, and then upload the updated definition.\nView Reference Nodes\nSelect a node and view the details of other nodes that currently reference elements of it, such as node sources and mapped fields. These nodes that reference the selected node are known as reference nodes. If you make changes to a node, it’s helpful to know its reference nodes to anticipate any changes that need to be made to them, too.\nWhy Does a Node Indicate That Removed Fields Are Referenced in a Node after the References Are Removed?\nWhen you remove fields from a node, ensure that the removed fields aren't referenced by any other node in the definition. The node in which you've already deleted references to the removed fields is used as a source by another node in which the removed fields are still referenced. To resolve this issue, go to the node in which you've deleted references to the removed fields. Next, find the nodes that use the current node as source and reference the removed field. Go to the nodes that still reference the removed fields, and then delete the references.\nSEE ALSO\nData Processing Engine Workflow\nData Processing Engine Nodes\nDefine Input Variables\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
