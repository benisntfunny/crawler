What are Product and Service Notifications?\nProduct and Service Notifications are communications from the Salesforce Technology Communications & Readiness team sent to admins of Salesforce orgs via email to alert them of any changes to features, functionality, or service that may impact their use of Salesforce. These notifications may include actions admins must take to prepare for these changes.\n\nProduct & Service Notifications include:\n\nMajor Release Reminders\n​Off-Cycle Releases (outside of the 24-hour standard release window)\nProduct Behavior Change\nService Maintenances\nProduct & Feature Retirement Notifications & Newsletters\nInfrastructure Upgrades & Changes\n\n2. Who is the audience for Product and Service Notifications?\nOur target audience is a system administrator who manages changes to Salesforce features, functionality, or services on behalf of their organization. We define an admin as any user with a profile, permission set, or permission set group that has the following permissions enabled below:\n\nManage Users\nModify All Data\n\nFor Marketing Cloud, the permissions are:\n\nAdministrator\nMarketing Cloud Administrator\n\nCheck your profile or ask the system administrator of your Salesforce org to see if you have these permissions enabled.\n\nNOTE: If a change impacts a sandbox org, the admin(s) of the production org associated with the impacted sandbox org will receive the Product and Service Notification.\n\n3. Where can I manage my preferences for Marketing Communications from Salesforce?\nhttps://cloud.mail.salesforce.com/signup\n\n4. Why are these communications important?\nIf you are an admin of a Salesforce org, receiving these notifications is critical to preparing for changes that may impact your organization. Product and Service Notifications are not marketing emails; they are communications based on your organization’s Salesforce implementation.\n\n5. How often are these communications sent?\nEach type of communication has its notification cadence and guidelines. For planned activities, changes, and updates, our goal is to give customers as much notice as possible to prepare for the change, especially if there is an action they need to take. Additionally, reminders may be sent leading up to that change to ensure customers are aware and thoroughly prepared.\n\nThe following matrix provides you with an overview of the major communications and associated notification periods:\n\nProduct and Service Notifications\n\n\t\n\n1st Notification\n\n\t\n\nReminders or Updates\n\n\n\n\nMajor Release Reminders\n\n\t\n\n3 times per year\n\n\t\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\nOff-Cycle Release Notifications (Outside of the 24-hour standard release window)\n\n\t\n\n1 month\n\n\t\n\n1 week\n\n\n\n\nProduct Behavior Changes\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\n\n\nService Maintenance Notifications*\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\n\n\nProduct & Feature Retirement Notifications\n\n\t\n\nRefer to link\n\n\t\n\nSent via newsletter on the 3rd Tuesday of the month\n\n*Notification of Salesforce taking an extended or off-cycle maintenance\n\nAdditionally, please review the below list of other articles for more detailed information on specific communications:\n\nSalesforce Maintenance Schedule (covers System Maintenance and Release Maintenance)\n​Product & Feature Retirement Philosophy \nSalesforce Product & Feature Retirements\n\n\nMarketing Cloud: \n\nProduct and Service Notifications\n\n\t\n\n1st Notification\n\n\t\n\nReminders or Updates\n\n\n\n\nMajor Release Reminders- **Marketing Cloud\n\n**Social Studio\n\n \n\nSalesforce Marketing Cloud Release Schedule\n\n\t\n\n5 times per year\n\n5 times per year\n\n\t\n\nJanuary, March, June, August & October\n\n\n \n\n\nOff-Cycle Release Notifications (Outside of the 24-hour standard release window)\n\n\t\n\n1 month\n\n\t\n\n1 week\n\n\n\n\nProduct Behavior Changes\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\n\n\nService Maintenance Notifications* (Infrastructure Upgrade)\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\t\n\nVaries as needed\n\n\n\n\nProduct & Feature Retirement Notifications\n\n\t\n\nRefer to link\n\n\t\n\nOnce a month via the monthly digest\n\n*Notification of Salesforce taking an extended or off-cycle maintenance\n\n6. What email addresses are the Product and Service Notifications sent from?\nThese communications are sent from: noreply@salesforce.com, alerts@mail.salesforce.com, and techcomms@mail.salesforce.com with the header \"Product and Service Notification.”\n\n7. If the admin(s) for my organization works across multiple orgs, will that admin(s) receive multiple notifications for any given Product and Service Notification?\nAs Product and Service Notifications are sent to targeted customer lists based on whether or not a particular change will impact your organization, admins will receive a Product and Service Notification for each impacted orgs they manage.\n\nFor example, if you are an admin for three different orgs (each with a unique orgID), you will receive product and Service Notifications for each of those orgs whenever the org, or your users, are impacted by a change that may require you to take action.\n\n8. Where can I get information about the instance my Salesforce org is on?\nSign up for Trust notifications for your Salesforce instance on our Trust site. If you would like more details about what Trust notifications are and how to subscribe, you can review the Trust Notification User Guide.\n\n9. How can a user resubscribe to get the notifications again?\nOpen a case with Support via Salesforce Help and request to be unblocked from the product and service notifications. Note that it may take 7+ business days to process.\n\nKnowledge Article Number\n\n000387296\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
