It stores your financial transactions in a format optimized for export to your accounting system.\n\nNOTE Starting in March 2023, Salesforce offers Accounting Subledger built on the core Salesforce platform. This article provides information about that product. For information about the managed packaged version of Accounting Subledger, see Accounting Subledger Legacy Documentation. If you're not sure which version your institution uses, check with your Salesforce administrator.\nTransaction Journal Fields in Accounting Subledger\nThe Transaction Journal object includes multiple fields to help you understand the generated data related to your financial transactions. Accounting Subledger creates transaction journal records automatically for new or changed CRM financial records (sometimes called source records in this documentation).\nSource Records Eligibility\nAccounting Subledger applies eligibility criteria to select source records to process.\nAccounting States and Data Generation\nAccounting Subledger considers the accounting state of your source data when generating transaction journal records.\nDebits and Credits\nAccounting Subledger follows specific definitions to determine debit and credit amount types.\nGL Codes\nIn an accounting system, each line in a general ledger is assigned an account or a fund account. The GL Code field on the Transaction Journal object identifies each account. We assign GL codes based on accounting set fields.\nRevenues and Expenses\nAfter the Accounting Subledger job runs, it generates debit and credit entries differently for revenues and expenses.\nSet Up Page Layouts for Transaction Journal Records\nConfigure your own page layout for the Transaction Journal object to best fit your users' needs, and assign them to your user profiles.\nPayment Methods\nConfigure payment methods and their impact on transaction journal records.\nCash Flow Grouping\nConfigure how to group transaction journal records. Depending on the type of cash flows, identify them by fund account, or fund account and due date.\nAccounting Field Mappings\nCreate accounting field mappings to bring your data to custom fields on transaction journal records.\nTroubleshoot Issues with Transaction Journal Record Creation\nTo troubleshoot challenges with the creation of transaction journal records in Accounting Subledger, check your org setup and subledger job.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
