Home Health takes care of creating each individual visit and assigning the appropriate care resources while you move on to the next task.\n\nVisit Assignment\n\nHome Health uses enhanced schedule optimization to ensure that care resources spend more time assisting patients and less time traveling to appointments. Home Health also automatically updates visit assignments when a care resource requests time off that conflicts with their visit assignments. To give schedulers enhanced visibility and greater control over care resource assignment, Home Health enables them to manually select the most suitable resource from a set of recommendations. Also, schedulers can reassign visits to different care resources in bulk.\n\nPatient Eligibility Verification\n\nHome health helps users to expedite the scheduling of recurring visits with a simplified, time-saving solution for patient eligibility verification. When schedulers create recurring visits, Home Health’s built-in flow verifies whether the patient is eligible by checking for an active member plan and benefit coverage of type Home Health. If the patient is eligible, a message indicating the same appears. This automated background check helps schedulers to cut down on repetitive eligibility verification steps and helps them avoid any unintended manual errors during verification.\n\nPrior-Authorization Integration\n\nHome Health has an optional integration with Utilization Management that can streamline your operations. You can use Utilization Management to request authorization from the payer for a patient’s home healthcare service requests. When the payer processes the request and returns the authorization data, Home Health uses the data to schedule the appropriate number of recurring visits. You can choose to indicate that authorization is required when you schedule visits. When you do so, Home Health runs checks in the background to ensure you don’t schedule more visits than are approved. Your organization can avoid unnecessary disputes and ensure compliance by using these validations, so we highly recommend that you use Home Health with Utilization Management.\n\nSchedule Visits with Home Health\nSchedulers can schedule visits for their patients using the New Home Visit button on the patient’s record page. You can schedule a start-of-care visit for an initial assessment, or you can schedule a set of recurring visits in bulk for the service you’re providing.\nSchedule Dependent Visits with Home Health\nDeliver timely and optimal care to your patients by staying on top of complex and dependent visits that require two care resources to cater to a patient at the same time. As a scheduler, you can use Home Health to easily create two dependent visits for a patient in a single go.\nSchedule Group Visits with Home Health\nAs a scheduler, you can simplify the scheduling process and provide better tracking by creating a group visit for multiple patients in nearby locations and with similar health conditions. Home Health bundles patient visits into a single group visit and assigns a single care resource to the group visit.\nReschedule Visits with Home Health\nIf a patient is unavailable for a visit, you can reschedule that visit from their patient record page.\nReschedule Subsequent Recurring Visits with Home Health\nAs a scheduler, you can reschedule a series of upcoming recurring visits in one go, depending on a patient’s availability and preferences. Home Health’s support for rescheduling a series of subsequent visits helps you increase operational efficiencies and reduce the administrative delays that arise when you manually reschedule each visit one at a time.\nReassign Visits to Another Care Resource with Home Health\nIf a care resource assigned to one or more visits asks for a change in assignments, you can reassign those visits to another care resource from their record page. For the reassignment, you can either manually select the new care resource to assign the visits to, or you can let Home Health automatically assign the visits to a new care resource.\nPerform Visits in the Field with Home Health\nCare resources can perform home visits in the field using Home Health in the Field Service mobile app. You can see what visits you’re scheduled for, get directions to the visit location, and see the lists of tasks you have to complete for the visit. And if you have the right permissions, you can even see the patient’s clinical data.\nRefresh Home Visit Counts\nAs a scheduler, get an accurate and up-to-date visit count for a care service visit plan associated with a patient. Home Health’s Update Care Visit Count flow works in the background and automates the calculation of assigned, unassigned, completed, and created visit counts. This built-in flow with its business rules and logic helps you speed up process management, save time, and reduce administrative errors.\nBroadcast Visits with Home Health\nAs a scheduler, you can handle the ever-increasing demand for care resources by broadcasting home visits to resources in multiple service regions. Broadcasting helps you save time, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure patients receive timely care. To help you get a broader reach, you can broadcast up to 50 home visits to three service regions at a time.\nAccept Broadcasted Home Visits\nAs a care resource, use your Field Service Mobile app to see a list of visits your scheduler broadcasted. Review the visit details and accept them if your schedule permits. When you accept a broadcasted visit, you play a key role in preventing no-shows and ensuring patients receive timely care.\nCancel Visits with Home Health\nVisit cancellations are unavoidable. That’s why Home Health provides a quick and flexible cancellation process to save time, minimize manual errors, and promote efficient resource utilization. As a scheduler, you can cancel a single visit or multiple upcoming recurring visits in one go if your care resources or patients can’t make it to their appointments on the scheduled date.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
