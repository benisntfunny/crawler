It then deploys the metadata from the target stage's branch to the target stage's org.\nIf the deployment fails, we don’t finalize the merge to the target stage's branch. All branches remain in the state they were before you attempted the promotion.\nIf you perform a validate-only deployment, we don’t merge any changes to the target stage's branch until you perform the Quick Deploy.\nDeploy Changes Using Salesforce CLI\n\nYou can deploy externally merged changes to the associated pipeline environment or perform a validate-only deployment using Salesforce CLI. See External Change Requests and Merges and Deploy Changes Using Salesforce CLI (Beta) for details.\n\nPromotion Options (Bundling and Versioned Pipeline Stages Only)\n\nIf you’re promoting from the bundling or a versioned pipeline stage, we provide these promotion options.\n\nPromote now—Promote all versioned work item bundles to the next pipeline stage.\nRun a validate-only deployment—Run a validation to check the results of Apex tests and deploying components without saving any components in the org. See Run a Validate-Only Deployment for details.\nChanges to Promote\n\nWhen you promote individual work items through the pipeline, you can select whether to deploy only the items that changed or all the changes in the target stage’s branch.\n\nChanges not in the <stage-name>’s branch (recommended)—Deploy only the files from that target stage's branch that aren’t yet in the target stage's org. In effect, you’re deploying only the files (changes) that recently came from the originating stage as part of this promotion. This behavior is the default, and is more efficient because we're deploying fewer files. In most circumstances, selecting this option is sufficient.\nAll metadata in the <stage-name>’s branch—Deploys all files in the target stage’s branch to the target stage’s org, after the branch has been merged. Select this option if your deployments are failing due to dependent or missing metadata. In some cases, the metadata doesn’t exist in the defined set of changes yet exists in the target stage branch. This option is useful when you or a colleague has committed and merged changes to the branch outside of DevOps Center but DevOps Center doesn’t know about them.\nApex Test Options\n\nWhen you promote work items through the pipeline, decide which Apex tests to run based on pipeline stage and to which environments you’re deploying changes.\n\nDefault—In sandboxes and scratch orgs, no tests are run. In production, all local tests are run if your changes contain Apex classes or triggers. This option excludes tests included in installed packages.\nRun local tests—All local tests are run, excluding tests included in installed packages.\nRun all tests—All tests in your org are run, including tests from installed packages.\nRun specified tests—Only the tests that you specify are run. Provide the names of test classes in a comma-separated list (no spaces between entries). Example: TestDeleteData,TestDataFactory.createTestRecords\nSEE ALSO\nApex Developer Guide: Testing and Code Coverage\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
