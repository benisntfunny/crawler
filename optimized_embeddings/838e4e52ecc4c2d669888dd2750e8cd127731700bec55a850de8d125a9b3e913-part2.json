The Account Name field isn’t auto-populated with the person account until the user saves the case.\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, email open tracking information appears in a related list. In Lightning Experience, email open tracking appears in the activity timeline for emails sent using the Lightning Email action. For detailed email open tracking information and information about List Emails, see the HTML Status report on the Reports tab.\n\nCampaigns\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nCampaign Influence 1.0\t\t\tUse the newer Campaign Influence instead.\nContracts\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nContracts\t\t\t\n\nIn Lightning Experience:\n\nStatus picklist values aren’t filtered based on a contract’s status, so all status values appear in the picklist.\nThe Draft and Activated status picklist values are required. To show users different labels for these picklist values, use Translation Workbench. You can also add other status picklist values.\nLeads\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nCampaign lookup field\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, use the Campaign History related list on lead pages.\nConverting leads\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, the user who coverts a lead owns the newly created account, not the lead owner.\nSearch for Duplicates button\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, admins can add the Potential Duplicates component to lead page layouts.\nOpportunities\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nOpportunity products\t\t\t\n\nIn Lightning Experience:\n\nWhile adding or editing opportunity products, users can’t edit long text fields, custom date/time fields, or custom time fields.\nRevenue schedule items and quantity schedule items created from a default schedule that fall on the same date aren’t merged. They appear as separate rows in the product schedule, and users can edit them individually.\nWhen users create an opportunity from a related list that’s based on a custom lookup field, they aren't prompted to add products.\n\nSimilar opportunities\t\t\t\nContact roles on opportunities\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, users are limited to adding or editing 200 opportunity contact roles at a time.\nCompetitor tracking\t\t\t\nOrders\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nCloning orders\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, products aren’t cloned when you clone an order. Clone the order, then add products to the new order.\nDraft and Activated statuses\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, the Draft and Activated status picklist values are required. To show users different labels for these picklist values, use Translation Workbench. You can also add other status picklist values.\nStatus picklists\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, status picklist values aren’t filtered based on an order’s status. All status values appear in the picklist.\nReduce and reduction orders\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, the Reduce Orders button isn’t available. As a workaround in Lightning Experience, create reduction orders using the Order and OrderItem API standard objects.\nProducts and Price Books\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nArchiving products and price books\t\t\tAs an alternative, you can deactivate products and price books. When they’re deactivated, all the records related to them are preserved.\nProducts and price books\t\t\t\nLightning Experience merges a product’s standard and custom price book entries into a single Price Books related list. By contrast, Salesforce Classic has separate related lists for Standard Prices and Price Books.\n\nYou could have previously removed the Price Books related list because you use standard prices only. To show your users standard prices in Lightning Experience, add the list back to the Product page layout.\n\nFor orgs already activated, the Add to Price Book page doesn’t include the Use Standard Price option by default. To make Use Standard Price available, add it to your Price Book Entry page layouts.\nFor orgs already activated, the Price Books home page doesn’t include an All Price Books list view by default. We recommend creating this list view to give your users access to price book records.\nIf you overwrote custom Add Products actions, Save and Add Products doesn't redirect users to custom Visualforce pages.\nSalesforce Console for Sales\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nSalesforce Console\t\t\t\n\nLightning console apps don’t yet have full parity with Salesforce Classic console apps. For example, some features in Salesforce Classic console apps, such as push notifications and custom keyboard shortcuts, aren’t available in Lightning console apps. Learn more.\n\nYou can’t upgrade Salesforce Classic console apps to Lightning Experience from Setup. To get started in Lightning Experience, customize the Salesforce-provided Sales Console app.\n\nTerritory Management\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nEnterprise Territory Management\t\t\tIn the Assigned Territories related list on accounts, you can assign territories only in your active territory model. Use the Manually Assigned Accounts related list on a territory’s detail page in Setup instead.\nOther Sales Features\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nContacts to multiple accounts\t\t\tOnly row-level actions that are specific to the Account Contact Relationship object are available in the Related Accounts and Related Contacts related lists. Actions to view or remove the account-contact relationship are available, but no actions are available to edit or delete the contact or account record.\nDivisions\t\t\t\n\nTo complete these tasks, switch to Salesforce Classic.\n\nApply Division filters to List Views and Reports\nCreate and edit divisions\nChange your working division\nTransfer multiple records between divisions (Mass Division Transfer)\n\nSocial accounts, contacts, and leads\t\t\t\nTwitter is the only social network available in Lightning Experience.\nTwitter is styled as its own card, visible within the News tab on accounts, contact, and lead record pages.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
