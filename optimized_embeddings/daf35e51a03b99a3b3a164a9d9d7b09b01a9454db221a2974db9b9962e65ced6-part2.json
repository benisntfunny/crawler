This section contains definitions, followed by two strategies for adding business value to the user case and requirements.\n\nDefinitions:\n\nPayment Gateways\n\nGateways are third-party software that provides connectivity to various payment processing networks, such as Visa and American Express. The Payment Method object provides a token that the Payment Gateway can use to process a payment.\n\nUse a Payment Gateway for customer security, including:\n\nCybersource\nAuthorize.net\nPayeezy\nSalesforce Billing, which integrates with any payment gateway or API integration\n\nPayment Transactions\n\nThese records of attempted payments store information such as Invoice, Payment Method, Gateway used and response, and reason for failure (if applicable).\n\nPayment Schedulers\n\nThe Payment Scheduler automatically collects electronic payments for outstanding invoices.\n\nYou can configure Payment Scheduler to run once or schedule recurring payment runs.\n\nSelf-Service Payments\n\nThey allow the customer to pay their own invoices.\n\nYou can expose a Payment Terminal through an Experience Cloud site or use Lightning Platform to create public websites and applications that directly integrate with your Salesforce organization.\n\nStrategy 1: Use Salesforce Billing Hosted Card Payment\n\nEmbed Salesforce Billing as an iFrame in the B2B Checkout flow for payment processing. Directly collect customer payments into Salesforce CPQ+. Salesforce Billing eliminates the need to integrate transactional data objects from the storefront data model to Salesforce.\n\nPROS\tCONS\n\n\nSalesforce Billing directly captures payment details (tokenized credit card or electronic payment details).\n\nPCI compliance is better because there’s no transfer of secure information like credit card details.\n\n\t\n\nThe payment page has limited styling options.\n\nAuthorization and Settlement (Charge) happen in a single action with the out-of-box payment gateway connector for billing.\n\nSalesforce Billing lets you manually collect and allocate payments or automate the payment process. You can then post the payment to keep your books up to date.\n\nApply and process CC and ACH payments through payment gateways and lockbox integrations. You can also apply manual payments.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\nEnable the Billing HPP Component setting in Salesforce Billing.\nModify the component based on your org’s payment and card-saving needs for the attributes.\nThere’s no requirement for syncing payment details between B2B and Billing.\nAfter the Payment Scheduler runs in Salesforce Billing, it processes the outstanding invoices with the selected payment method.\nPayment Scheduler generates data for the “Payment” and “Payment Transaction” records.\nStrategy 2: Use Default Storefront Gateway and Custom Integration\n\nUse the out-of-the box Payment Gateway with Storefronts and custom integration. Connect to Salesforce Billing or external ERP. Use out-of-the box Commerce Storefront to process payment directly in Commerce Storefront. It uses a default Payment Gateway Connector option.\n\nPROS\tCONS\n\n\nThere are no changes to the out-of-box Payment Gateway connector or the checkout flow in B2B.\n\nAuthorization and Settlement can happen as part of a separate transaction.\n\n\t\n\nStorefront Gateway requires customization to sync the B2B Transaction Payment details to Billing.\n\nProcess Payment using the default Payment Gateway connectors in B2B. Sync the Electronic Payment transaction details to Salesforce Billing.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nConfigure Payment Gateway in Salesforce Billing.\nEnable Hosted Payment Page (HPP) for the Org by contacting Salesforce support.\nClone the Permission set “Hosted Payment User”, and enable it.\nEnable “Allow Payment Using Card Hosted Payment Component” for the Experience site users.\nAdd Permissions to the Community user profile.\n\nImplementation Approach\n\nTo design a Component that loads the HPP component, create the Lightning Component.\nPublish the “ccrz__E_StoredPayment__c” and “ccrz__E_TransactionPayment__c” associated with the B2B Order to the Billing Payment Method “blng__PaymentMethod__c.”\nTo publish Payment Method details to Billing, publish details from B2B to Salesforce Billing. Refer to sample code. Use a trigger on the “CC Stored Payment” or “CC Transaction Payment” records. Note: the code snippet is for guidance only.\nThe lightning component has the “transactionType” as “SavePaymentCard.” It ensures a capture of payment details without immediate processing.\nCreate a Lightning component with “force:cardPayment.”\nCreate a Lightning app with the extension “ltng:outApp.”\nCreate the Visual Force page for payments. Refer to sample code.\nUpdate CC Admin Config:\nCreate a module from the CC Admin Storefront → configuration setting, and select “Create Module.”\nThe checkout module includes a newly created module.\nApprove the Visual Force page in the Payment Module.\nRelated Content\n\t\n\nReview earlier steps in this solution.\n\nWorkflow\nDesign Considerations\nConnector\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
