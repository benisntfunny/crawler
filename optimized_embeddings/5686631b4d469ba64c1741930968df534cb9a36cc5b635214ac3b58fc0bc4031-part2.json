Save time on manual tasks with automatic success team assignments and program management. Follow your learners' journey with a unified record view and dedicated director and advisor consoles. Cultivate your learners' success by tracking any roadblocks they encounter with care plans and alerts. Increase student engagement with new mobile-ready Student Success portal components, which give enrolled students access to all relevant information such as their advisors' drop-in availability. And with Marketing Cloud Engagement for Education, connect more efficiently with your learners by using out-of-the box email templates.\n\nTailor User Access to Education Cloud Features\nProvide your users access to the features that they need by using the new standard permission set, Education Cloud Limited Access. This permission set grants wider access to Education Cloud features than Education Cloud Reviewer. For clarity, consistency, and to accommodate additional use cases, the Education Cloud Reviewer license is now Education Cloud Limited Access.\nStudent Success App\nThe new Student Success app provides a central place for your institution to offer proactive and personalized support to learners for academics, sports, health, financial aid, and so on. Get insights from analytics dashboards, view in-depth learner information using the student snapshot component, monitor learner progress and create alerts, design programs and individualized care plans, and assign and manage success teams. When an advisor or a director opens the app, they see a home page with features curated for their role and license type.\nStudent Success Components for Your Learner Portal\nUse Experience Builder to enhance your institution's learner portal with new mobile-ready Lightning web components for student success. From the learner portal, learners can conveniently schedule and manage appointments, view their assigned success teams and care plans, and manage their tasks.\nAssist Learners with Program Management\nWithin the Student Success app, your institution can effectively define, plan, and deliver non-scholastic services and initiatives that support each learner’s journey. Directors can model programs with supported benefits, and then schedule and track the benefit disbursements to recipients.\nSupport Learners with Care Plans\nDirectors and advisors can now create personalized care plans with goals and tasks to help learners achieve their objectives. Use care plan templates to quickly create care plans with frequently used goals or tasks. Use the bulk operation to apply care plans to multiple record alerts at a time.\nMonitor Learner Performance with Alerts\nDirectors and advisors can now create alerts that notify them about learner performance so that they can offer timely support when required. Use flows to automatically create alerts for multiple learner records.\nAutomate Case Management and Success Team Assignment\nEducational institutions provide support to learners in many areas, including financial aid, academic advising, and disability services. Use the flow templates in Education Cloud to automate case creation and closure, and the assignment of success teams to learners.\nImprove Your Admission Rate by Focusing on Prospective Students Most Likely to Join\nGet predictions about the likelihood of a prospective student joining your educational institution based on their current level of engagement with the institution. Share these predictions with your admissions team so that they can focus on the right prospective students and improve your rate of admissions.\nAutomate the Application Review Process\nWhen a prospective student applies to your institution, the application goes through a review and approval process that involves multiple reviewers with different review purposes. Education Cloud provides flow templates to automatically assign the individual application record to the person who's responsible for the next part of the review process.\nSet Up Marketing Cloud Engagement for Education\nLeverage the power of Marketing Cloud Engagement with a prebuilt connector that retrieves up-to-date Education Cloud data for your marketing campaigns. Communicate efficiently with learners with out-of-the box templates to support your recruitment, admissions, and student success activities. Schedule automated emails to remind learners of upcoming application deadlines, or appointment confirmations after they schedule a meeting with your staff.\nSet Up Drop-In Appointments\nSupport learners seeking ad-hoc help from your staff by setting up drop-in shifts for in-person appointments.\nSchedule Appointments on Behalf of Students\nStaff can schedule appointments on behalf of a learner from the learner's person account record.\nManage Appointments with Salesforce Scheduler\nBeginning Summer '23, Salesforce Scheduler is available within your Salesforce org. Your users are entitled to 12,000 appointments per org per year. In addition to the entitlement per org, Salesforce Scheduler allows 1800 appointments per user license per year for the Enterprise Edition licenses. For Unlimited Edition licenses, the limit increases to 2400 appointments per user license per year.\nSalesforce Scheduler Add-On License for Additional Appointments\nAccommodate more appointments with Salesforce Scheduler’s add-on license. Salesforce Scheduler Additional Appointments AddOn license offers an added capacity of 12,000 appointments.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
