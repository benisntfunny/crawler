Accounting Subledger only considers records created on or after this date.\nRun Order\tDetermines the sequence in which accounting sets run. Accounting Subledger applies this number in ascending order and processes accounting sets with an empty run order last. If you have multiple sets with the same run order, we sort by ascending order of their developer name.\nDefault Accrued Account Code\tThe code for your accounting system's default accrual account. See GL Codes.\nDefault Write Off Account Code\tThe code for your accounting system's written-off payments. See GL Codes.\nExpected Cash Flow Grouping\tDetermines whether Accounting Subledger groups transaction journal records by fund account or by a combination of fund account and due date. Changing this setting doesn't impact existing records; it only affects records created or reversed afterwards. See Cash Flow Grouping.\nPaid Cash Flow Grouping\t\n\nDetermines the level of detail for generated transaction journal records:\n\nGroup by Summary: Accounting Subledger only splits credits for revenue and debits for expenses by fund accounts.\nGroup by Fund Account: Accounting Subledger splits all transaction journal records by fund accounts. Then, it creates secondary records for payment type records, but not for transaction type records.\n\nChanging this setting impacts existing records, so we recommend that you don't do so if you already generated accounting data. See Cash Flow Grouping.\n\nSelect the condition logic to determine which records to process:\nAll Conditions Are Met (AND): Records that meet all the criteria.\nAny Condition Is Met (OR): Records that meet at least one criteria.\nNo Conditions Are Met: All records except records that meet any of the criteria.\nSet up criteria as needed:\nResource: Fields from the accounting set's primary object. For formula fields, Salesforce retrieves the last values sent to the Data Processing Engine, rather than the current values when processing the formula. To avoid discrepancies, we recommend that you don't use formula fields based on time boundaries. The dropdown doesn't list all fields. See Accounting Subledger Limitations.\nOperator: How to evaluate the field value.\nValue: The field value to evaluate, depending on the select field. For example, a checkbox's possible values are True or False, and numeric values are numbers.\nSelect the record types to process from the primary object. This field is case-sensitive.\nClick Finish.\nExample Criteria Settings\nReview an example of criteria settings to generate transaction journal records only for certain types of fees.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
