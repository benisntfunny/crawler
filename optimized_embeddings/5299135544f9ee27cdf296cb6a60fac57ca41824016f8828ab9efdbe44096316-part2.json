The registration process connects a method to the user’s Salesforce account. As you approach your launch date, it’s time to distribute verification methods to users, along with instructions for the registration process.\n\nWe recommend distributing methods one to two weeks before you turn on MFA. Users can self-register verification methods at any time. Encourage everyone to register at least one method prior to your launch date so they can avoid delays logging in when MFA is live. It’s a good idea for users to set up multiple verification methods so they don’t get locked out of their account if they forget or lose one of their options.\n\nTIP Want to help your users with the registration process by providing onboarding help ahead of time? Check out the downloadable MFA Rollout Pack. It provides customizable onboarding templates for each of the verification methods that are supported by Salesforce products.\n\nThe registration steps vary slightly for each verification method. And the way a user starts the self-registration process depends on the Salesforce product. Use these resources for step-by-step details.\n\nProducts built on the Salesforce Platform (including Sales Cloud and Service Cloud)\nB2C Commerce Cloud\nHeroku\nMarketing Cloud Engagement (powered by Email, Messaging, and Journeys)\nMarketing Cloud Intelligence (powered by Datorama)\nMarketing Cloud Social\nMuleSoft Anypoint Platform\nTableau Cloud\nNOTE If a user doesn’t have a method ready by the time MFA is turned on, they automatically go through the registration process the next time they log in. On-screen prompts guide users through the steps.\n\nConsider these guidelines as you prepare to distribute verification methods.\n\nHold a few registration sessions or office hours before your launch day so users can get help if they need it.\n\nFor authenticator apps:\nTo ensure the security of mobile authenticator apps such as Salesforce Authenticator or Google Authenticator, require users to set a PIN or biometric factor on their mobile device. (Note that mobile devices must be secured before users can register mobile authenticator apps for B2C Commerce.)\nFor security keys:\nAllow enough time to deliver them to users before your launch date. Decide if you’re going to hand-deliver keys or if users must pick them up at a designated location. If you have remote users or offices in various regions, add a buffer for shipping delays.\nHave an extra supply of security keys on hand for your launch day in case some users received a malfunctioning key or didn’t get their key in time.\nFor built-in authenticators:\nBefore registering this type of verifier, a user's built-in authenticator service (such as Touch ID, Face ID, or Windows Hello) must be enabled and set up to verify their identity.\nSEE ALSO\nVerification Methods for Multi-Factor Authentication\nPrepare Your Users for Multi-Factor Authentication\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
