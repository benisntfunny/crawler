To validate the claims submitted by subsidiaries of distributors or ship-to partners, define the types of relationships between the related parties and create relationships between their accounts.\n\nAdd Ship and Debit Program Members\nRebate program managers can enroll partners and customers to ship and debit programs by creating Rebate Program Member records. Add partners, distributors, or dealers who get the ship and debit rebates to a ship and debit program as accounts. Specify ship-to partners and customers to whom distributors must sell products to get the ship and debit incentives as ship-to accounts.\nCreate Party Role Relationships for Rebate Program Members\nDefine the relationship of two accounts or two contacts that are related to each other by using Party Role Relationship records. Some relationships can be reciprocal, such as the parent-child relationship between a distributor and their regional subsidiary. Some relationships can be linear, such as the relationship between two regional dealers that are subsidiaries of the same ship-to account.\nCreate Account Account Relationships for Rebate Program Members\nDefine a relationship between two business accounts by creating Account Account Relationship records. You can relate parent and child accounts or peer accounts. For example, a distributor and its regional subsidiary can be related with each other in a parent-child relationship. Create account account relationships between a distributor or a ship-to partner and their child accounts to validate the ship and debit claims submitted by a child account.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
