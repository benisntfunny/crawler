Offer assistance through a direct or indirect transfer of resources or credits for a specific period. For example, assist eligible low-income households with their heating and cooling energy costs by offering the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).\n\nSpecify who is eligible to apply for the benefits based on their age, income, expenses, household size, and other criteria. Review and screen applications and approve the ones that are eligible. Assign benefits to eligible applicants and specify details such as the amount and frequency of the benefit. Configure benefits to be disbursed automatically for upcoming payment schedules or disburse them manually.\n\nEnable constituents to search for benefits that they’re eligible for and apply for them. Also enable them to track the status of their applications and the benefits assigned to them, and view a schedule of payments that they can expect to receive. Also share the reasons behind these decisions with your constituents.\n\nNOTE\n\nCustomer is solely responsible for any use of sample, example, or template benefit eligibility criteria, formulae, or similar schema provided with Benefit Management. Customer must ensure that any benefit eligibility decision-making by Customer using such sample, example, or template benefit eligibility determination tools are used: (i) only by authorized personnel of Customer; and (ii) in compliance with applicable laws and regulations to which Customer is subject.\n\nBenefit Management Prerequisites\nBefore you set up benefit management in Public Sector Solutions, complete the prerequisites.\nSet Up the Eligibility Assessment Flow for Your Benefit Assistance Site\nTo specify eligibility criteria and set up the assessment, customize the OmniScript, create a decision matrix, build an expression set, and activate the OmniScript.\nAutomate Eligibility Determinations\nUse Business Rules Engine to determine benefit eligibility and the benefit amounts for qualified applicants. First, create a decision matrix that defines the income threshold based on the income and household size. Then build an expression set that uses the matrix to find benefit eligibility and calculate eligible benefit amounts. Use Decision Explainer to share the reasoning behind application decisions, eligibility determinations, and benefit amount calculations with constituents.\nDeploy the Benefit Management Discovery Framework Template\nDeploy version v5 of the Discovery Framework sample template for benefit management in Public Sector Solutions.\nSet Up Benefit Application Intake\nUse Discovery Framework assessment questions and OmniScripts to capture information from constituents who apply for a benefit. Store assessment questions responses in Salesforce objects using OmniStudio Integration Procedures and Omnistudio Data Mappers. Capture effective start and end dates when you store income and expense data. Use Business Rules Engine to automate benefit eligibility determination.\nSet Up the Change of Circumstances Application Flow\nSet up a guided flow on your Experience Cloud site that constituents can use to report changes of circumstance that affect benefit or service eligibility. Review the changes in an individual application record, and adjust the services or benefits assigned to constituents as necessary.\nSet Up the Benefit Recertification Flow\nEnable constituents to recertify for benefits on your Experience Cloud site. Show them benefits that are pending recertification and give them a guided flow to review the information that they previously provided, confirm or update details, upload supporting documents, and submit their recertification application.\nSet Up the Benefit Application Review Flow\nConfigure a guided flow for caseworkers to use to check whether benefit, change of circumstances, and benefit recertification applications are complete and accurate, to determine eligibility, and to assign and adjust benefits and services.\nAlert Applicants When Their Benefit Application Status Changes\nKeep applicants informed of the progress of their benefit applications by using a flow to automatically send a desktop notification and an email to applicants when the status of their benefit application changes.\nBuild a Benefit Assistance Experience Cloud Site in Public Sector Solutions\nCreate an Experience Cloud site where constituents can apply and recertify for benefits, report a change of circumstances, and file complaints.\nProcess Benefit Applications by Using a Guided Flow\nCheck whether an application in review is complete and accurate. Correct details based on evidence and, if necessary, return the application for additional information. When the application is complete, if the applicants are eligible, assign them a benefit amount.\nProcess Change of Circumstance Applications by Using a Guided Flow\nCheck whether a change of circumstances application is complete and accurate. Correct details based on supporting documentation and, if necessary, return the application for additional information. When the application is complete and you have confirmed the details, accept or deny the application.\nProcess Benefit Assignment Adjustment Applications by Using a Guided Flow\nCheck the changes reported. View benefit assignment details and adjust the benefit amount to match the change in circumstances.\nProcess Benefit Recertification Applications by Using a Guided Flow\nCheck whether a recertification application is complete and accurate. Correct details based on supporting documentation and, if necessary, return the application for additional information. When the application is complete and you’ve confirmed the details, accept or deny the application. Renew or adjust the amount of benefits that constituents receive to match their benefit eligibility.\nAssign and Disburse Benefits to Eligible Applicants\nAssign benefits to eligible applicants and disburse the benefits by using flows in Public Sector Solutions.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
