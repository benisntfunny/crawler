    "content": "nullGet Started with Salesforce\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nClose\nClose\nSearch\nSearch\n Get Started with Salesforce\n What Is Salesforce?\n Log In, Navigate, and Search Salesforce\n Verify Your Identity\n Personalize Your Salesforce Experience\n\nYou are here:\n\nSALESFORCE HELP\nDOCS\nGET STARTED WITH SALESFORCE\nCreate or Clone a List View in Lightning Experience\n\nCreate a list view to see an infinitely scrollable list of records that meet your filter criteria.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create list views:\tRead on the type of record included in the list AND Create and Customize List Views\nTo create, edit, or delete public list views:\tManage Public List Views\nNOTE These steps work in Lightning Experience. If you see the App Launcher icon () on the left side of the navigation bar at the top of your screen, you're in Lightning Experience. If not, you're in Salesforce Classic.\n\nActions you can take for list views are available in the List View Controls menu .\n\nUnder List View Controls, select New. Or, click Clone to make a copy of the current list view.\nGive your list a name and unique API name.\nChoose who can see this list view: just you, or all users, including Partner and Customer Portal users.\nClick Save. The Filters panel appears.\nClick Show me, then select All objects or My Objects.\nClick Done.\nAdd and set filters to view only the records that meet your criteria. You have different options depending on the field you want to filter and the operator you choose.\nClick Add Filter.\nSelect the field to filter, an operator, and a value.\nDepending on the type of field you selected, you can either select a value or enter one of your own. Filters support values only between the minimum and maximum for a signed 32-bit integer, or between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,648. A value outside of this range disables that filter.\nClick Done.\nNOTE Entering illogical filter criteria, such as someDate <= null, can cause unexpected behavior in a list view. When you use a list view in a more strict context, such as with a Visualforce standard list controller, illogical filter criteria can cause errors.\nTo add logic that further refines which records appear in your list view, click Filter Logic. To reference filters in your logic statement, use the number assigned to each filter.\nIMPORTANT Include every filter number in your logic statement. You can’t have filters that aren’t referenced in the logic statement.\nOPERAND\tDEFINITION\nAND\t\n\nFinds records that match both values.\n\n1 AND 2\n\n\nOR\t\n\nFinds records that match either value.\n\n1 OR 2\n\n\nNOT\t\n\nFinds records that exclude values.\n\nFor example, Filter 1 is Industry equals Biotechnology. You set filter logic as NOT 1. Your report returns records that don’t have Biotechnology as the Industry value.\n\nLet’s say a rep wants to see all opportunities created in July 2015 or later, that are either in late stages of negotiation or have high probability to close, or both. Here are the filters.\n\nLast Modified Date greater or equal 7/1/2015\nStage contains Proposal/Price Quote, Negotiation/Review\nProbability greater or equal 50\n\nThen the rep adds the logic statement: 1 AND (2 OR 3)\n\nNOT doesn’t work with parenthetical expressions. For example, the expression 1 AND NOT (2 AND 3) evaluates as 1 AND (NOT 2 AND 3). In the filter results, no records are returned when you’d expect to see some records.\n\nClick Save. The view appears in the list view dropdown list so you can access it later. Pin a list view if you want it to load as the default list for that object.\nOptionally, choose and order the columns in your list view.\nFrom the List View Controls menu, Select Fields to Display.\nUse the arrows to add, remove, and reorder your visible fields.\nClick Save.\n\nIn list views, you see only the data that you have access to. You see records that you own or have read or write access to, and records shared with you. List views also include records owned by or shared with users in roles below you in the role hierarchy. You can see only the fields that are visible according to your page layout and field-level security settings.\n\nTo share a list view, select Sharing Settings from the List View Controls menu. From there, you can search through the roles in your org to find the groups you want to share your list view with.\n\nNOTE A user with the Manage Public List Views permission can view all public list views, even if they aren’t assigned to a group or role that a given list view is shared with.\n\nWhen you enable digital experiences, list views shared with the Roles and Internal Subordinates sharing group are automatically shared with the Roles, Internal, and Portal Subordinates group instead. If you don’t want external users to access these list views, update your sharing settings.\n\nSEE ALSO\nFilter Reports by Values\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
