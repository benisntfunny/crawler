You can use the Scheduled Switcher tool to switch users upon login on a daily or weekly basis.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo use the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant:\t\n\nView Setup and Configuration\n\nAND\n\nCustomize Application\n\nWhat’s this?\tFor users that aren’t taking advantage of Lightning Experience, the Scheduled Switcher feature automatically switches them from Salesforce Classic to Lightning Experience. A welcome mat informs them that they’ve been switched. It also includes resources to help them work smarter and faster in Lightning Experience.\nWhich users are affected?\t\n\nA user is switched to Lightning Experience only if the following conditions are met.\n\nAutomatic switching is enabled for either a weekly (default) or daily frequency.\nThe production org has Lightning Experience turned on.\nThe user has the Lightning Experience user permission, which grants access to Lightning Experience.\nThe user is using Salesforce Classic.\n\nHow often does switching happen?\tAdmins choose whether the switch occurs daily or weekly. The default is weekly. The approximate reset is 1:00 AM daily and Sunday 1:00 AM for weekly. Times are local time for the data center, which supports your instance. The switch happens the next time the user logs in.\nWhat options do users have?\tThe user can review the resources listed on the welcome mat to learn more about Lightning Experience. The user can also close the welcome mat. The mat is shown each time that the user is switched. If the switcher is available, users can switch back to Salesforce Classic.\nCan automatic switch be disabled?\tSalesforce recommends disabling it only for a limited group of users by using a permission set, instead of disabling it for the entire org. You can disable automatic switching for an org from the Optimize phase in the Transition Assistant.\nIs automatic switch enabled by default?\tAutomatic switching is enabled by default on a weekly basis. You can change to daily from the Optimize phase in the Transition Assistant.\nCan the welcome mat be disabled?\tYou can’t disable the welcome mat.\n\nTo control the Scheduled Switcher:\n\nFrom Setup in Lightning Experience, enter Lightning in the Quick Find box, then select Lightning Experience Transition Assistant. From Setup in Salesforce Classic, click Get Started in the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant tile at the top of the menu.\nSelect the Optimize phase.\nClick Motivate Users to Work in Lightning Experience to expand the stage.\nTurn on Switch users to Lightning Experience on a regular schedule.\nChoose the switching frequency.\nTo disable automatic switching for a specific group of users, create a permission set using the Remain in Salesforce Classic user permission. See Create Permission Sets. Chatter Free users, Chatter external users, and Guest users can’t be excluded from automatic switching using this permission. The ability to create a permission set for a small group of specific users isn’t available in the Group Edition.\nNOTE Ready to start turning off access to Salesforce Classic? See Make Lightning Experience the Only Experience for Some Users.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
