Schedule the flows at regular intervals. Use predefined flow actions to customize the rebate process as required. Configure an end-to-end orchestration flow to manage the rebate lifecycle. Use Batch Management capabilities to process a large number of filtered and aggregated transaction records in manageable chunks.\n\nHow Are Rebate Payouts Calculated?\nReview the necessary steps to calculate rebate payouts for the members in a rebate program. Transaction Journal records are used as the input for calculation, and the output is stored in Rebate Member Payout records.\nFlow Templates with Rebate Management\nRebate Management comes with Flow templates that help orchestrate rebate calculations. You can configure and use them for your end-to-end rebate calculations and extend the templates as required. The flows trigger the data processing engine definitions to update the aggregate records, and also trigger calculation processes to update the final payout amounts. Admins can schedule the flows at regular intervals.\nClone and Activate the Predefined Flow Definitions\nIt’s recommended you clone the Flow Builder templates readily available with Rebate Management. When you clone a template, the cloned template can be customized and then activated for rebate processing. You can also choose to create a flow from scratch, and add the required flow actions and data processing engine definitions to it.\nPredefined Flow Actions with Rebate Management\nUse flows to automate the processes of calculating rebates for members during a payout period. The members must be active and enrolled in an active rebate program. The rebate types and associated benefits must also be active. Admins can use predefined flow actions to extend the flow templates available with Rebate Management, or while creating a flow from scratch. Find the required flow actions in the Rebates category in Flow Builder.\nAdditional Learning Resources for Flow Builder\nCheck out these resources to learn how to best use Flow Builder.\nProcess Transactions with Batch Management\nUse Batch Management capabilities to process a large number of filtered and aggregated transactions in manageable batches, and calculate rebate amounts. Use the configurable Batch Management framework to modify the predefined batch definition, or create your own.\nPredefined Batch Management Jobs with Rebate Management\nRebate Management flows use Batch Management capabilities to process a large number of filtered and aggregated transactions to calculate rebate amounts. There are two predefined batch jobs Calculate Rebate Payout and Calculate Rebate payout for All Periods that are available with Rebate Management and can be used in any scheduled flow.\nAdditional Learning Resources for Batch Management\nCheck out these resources to learn more about Batch Management.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
