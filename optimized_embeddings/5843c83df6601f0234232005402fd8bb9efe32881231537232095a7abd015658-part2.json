Use the CPQ B2B Commerce Cloud Connector to link cart to cash.\n\nThe CPQ B2B Commerce Cloud Connector is an unmanaged package from Salesforce Labs. It allows B2B Commerce and CPQ customers to configure or customize functionality. Sync products, pricing, quote requests, and orders in both clouds.\n\nUse one data model, pricing engine, and a unified process built around customer engagement from CPQ. Create Omni-Channel customer-driven experiences.\n\nThe connector supports the following use cases:\n\nSynchronize Product and Price Data\nConvert Cart to Order\nRequest for a Quote\nBuy Again with Synchronized Order History\nGeneral Connector Information\nConnectors are a developer enablement framework that accelerates cross-cloud integration. Connectors aren’t a standalone product.\nConnectors support a core set of use cases and can be extended to support more customer-driven use cases.\nConnectors require customization and configuration in B2B Commerce and Salesforce CPQ.\nPlan your connector implementation with a data strategy and governance policy.\nWhat Your Company Can Do with This Connector\n\nEach connection point supports a core set of use cases enabled individually through custom metadata configurations. These connections meet your specific business requirements. You can disable them as needed, such as for scheduled maintenance or data ETL activities.\n\nProduct and Price book\nCart and Quoting\nOrders and CC Order\nNOTE See the following visualized data flows. You reduce system complexity with a unified master data, shared data model, and single source of truth.\n\nConnected Selling and Buying\n\nSynchronize Quoting and Order History.\n\nConnected Products and Pricing\n\nCreate CPQ Product and Price Data and Sync to B2B Commerce.\n\nNOTE The CPQ + B2B Connector supports a one-way sync for Product and Pricing logic.\nData Synchronization\nDATA SYNC\tAPPROACH\nProducts and Pricing\t\nPlatform Events\nScheduled Batch Classes\nQueue-able Framework\n\nTransactional Carts, Quotes, and Orders\t\nTriggers\nFuture Methods\n\nFactors to Consider\n\nVolume of data (product catalog and price lists)\nFrequency of changes in business process impacting Pricing or Product Data\nIntegrated systems and other data flows.\nScalability and performance\nConsiderations\n\nProduct and Pricing Assumptions\n\nThe Connector lets you sync Simple Products with a flat price.\n\nConnector Guardrails\n\nUnsupported Product Types\n\nTo support the following B2B products, make other customizations in the Connector sync:\n\nAggregate Products\nAssembly Products\n\nUnsupported Complex CPQ Product Bundles\n\nWithout other customizations, we don’t recommend using complex CPQ Product Bundles with many Options and Constraints. They’re not ideal for using with self-service or the Connector.\n\nB2B Product Entitlements\n\nThe Product and Pricing Sync process doesn’t automate the B2B Product Entitlements. Associate The “Account Groups” to the “Price Lists” after completing the Product and Pricing Sync in B2B Commerce.\n\nDiscounts and Promotions\n\nWe recommend that you manage discounts and promotions for B2B Commerce in B2B. Don’t sync the information from CPQ.\n\nData Strategy\n\nConnector Data Flow Strategy and Governance\n\nAdvanced product and pricing capabilities within CPQ aren’t available inB2B. For example, Bundles and Rules.\n\nERP as the Product and Pricing Master\n\nDon’t directly integrate B2B Commerce with the ERP. The functionality supported in the Connector and the approaches listed here assume that CPQ is the publishing data source for B2B Commerce.\n\nProduct Index Synchronization\n\nSynced Products in B2B appear only in a Storefront after refreshing the Product Index.\n\nRelated Content\n\t\n\nReview earlier steps in this solution.\n\nWorkflow\nDesign Considerations\n\n\t\n\nTake the next steps in this implementation.\n\nConfigurations\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
