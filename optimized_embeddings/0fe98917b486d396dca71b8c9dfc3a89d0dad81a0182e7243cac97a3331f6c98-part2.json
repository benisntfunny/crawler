In Lightning Experience, set a file to privately shared to a record to achieve similar functionality.\nLibraries\t\t\t\n\nLibraries are available in both Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic.\n\nIn Lightning Experience, you can further organize your library content with folders. You can create, rename, and delete library folders, and move library files into folders.\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, there are some advanced library administration options that aren’t available in Lightning Experience:\n\nViews\n\nTop Content\nPopular Tags\nRecent Activity\nMost Active Contributors\n\nManage members: Filter existing members to show only\n\nIndividual Users\nPublic Groups\nStandard Users\nCustomer Portal Users\nPartner Users\n\nManage library\n\nDefine record types for the library from the UI\nView archived content\nSubscribe to the library\nCreate content as a link to external content by adding a URL instead of uploading content, or add a link to a Google Doc\nMove a file to another library\n\nNotes and Attachments roll up on parent object\t\t\t\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, files in the Notes & Attachments related list roll up to display on the record of a parent object. (For example, and account could display all files attached to related contacts and opportunities.)\n\nIn Lightning Experience, you can share your Salesforce Files with multiple records. A file posted on an opportunity can also be shared to the parent account. As long as the file isn’t private, then you can view the file from the account. You can create a trigger on ContentDocumentLink to do this sharing automatically.\n\n\nSubscriptions\t\t\tNot available within Lightning Experience, including viewing and removing subscriptions.\nReceive email notifications when content subscriptions are updated\t\t\tNot available in Lightning Experience. One workaround is to create a trigger to notify users of changes to the content.\nContent tags\t\t\tNot available in Lightning Experience.\nContent Detail page\t\t\t\n\nIn Salesforce Classic a Content Detail page is available with some information that is not available in Lightning Experience:\n\nContent Tags\nSubscriptions to content, authors, or tags\nContent rating\nContent archiving\nView of usernames who downloaded content\n\nContent tab\t\t\t\n\nIn Salesforce Classic a Content tab is available with some information that is not available in Lightning Experience:\n\nSearch within the library\nSearch facets\nCustomizing the list view columns\nMass download of files\n\nContent Deliveries\t\t\tNot available in Lightning Experience. Public links also let you share content, but don’t provide a password protection option. Content Deliveries are exposed in the API, so you could create a custom component to provide this functionality in Lightning Experience.\nFiles\t\t\t\n\nIn Salesforce Classic the Files tab and Files Detail page are available with some functionality that is not available in Lightning Experience:\n\nFilter by All Files\nMake Private action to unshare from all locations\nShare a file with the company\nDocuments\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nDocuments\t\t\tDocuments aren’t available in Lightning Experience. To use documents in Lightning Experience, export them in your weekly export or using Data Loader. Then upload them into Lightning Experience as Salesforce Files.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
