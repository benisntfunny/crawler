Evaluate how well your published content performs, and then update, add, or delete content as your learning and enablement strategy matures. You can also transfer your content to another system by quickly exporting all content that’s been published or archived on your enablement site.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER ROLES\nThis topic supports these enablement site roles:\t\nSalesforce Admins\nContent Creators\nRelease Managers\nView Learner Feedback for Your Published Modules\nAfter a learner completes the units in one of your published modules, they can rate the module on a five-star scale. In Trailmaker Settings, you can view the aggregated ratings, which your content creators can use to inform the next steps in their learning and enablement strategy.\nInsert a Survey in a Unit on Your Enablement Site\nComplement the general feedback you gather from badge ratings with specific, actionable feedback from learners who complete your enablement content. In a unit, you can insert a survey from an external hosting platform that allows you to embed the survey in another web page. For example, use platforms such as Salesforce Feedback Management, SurveyMonkey™, or GetFeedback. Including a survey directly in your content allows your company to encourage survey completion, avoid sending the survey in a separate communication, and scale your change management.\nMaintain Content with Trailmaker Content\nUse Trailmaker Content to keep your content current. For example, you can edit existing content to correct errors or update work processes. You also can add a unit to an existing module or add a module to an existing trail.\nExport All Published and Archived Content from an Enablement Site\nTo back up all content that’s been published or archived on your enablement site, you can quickly download backpacks of all published and archived trails and modules. This option is also useful when you want to transfer your content to another system.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
