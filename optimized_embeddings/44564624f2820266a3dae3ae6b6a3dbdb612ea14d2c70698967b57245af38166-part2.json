This is the stage to make the case for moving to Lightning Experience by calculating the return on investment your company will get and defining what your Lightning Experience implementation will look like. Use the information you collect in this stage to define business and technical requirements and the level of effort for your rollout.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nLightning Experience has good parity with Sales Cloud features in Salesforce Classic and is quickly catching up on Service Cloud features, closing gaps with each new release. Part of your evaluation is to identify how important upcoming features are to your business needs.\n\nKeep in mind that you can roll out Lightning Experience over time, enabling different groups of users as you go. This flexibility means you can move your Sales teams now while leaving your Service org in Salesforce Classic until later. Or even better, start with a pilot group that can evaluate Lightning Experience features and assess how your processes and customizations are working. Use feedback from the pilot group to iterate on your implementation, then continue moving over other groups that benefit from your enhancements.\n\nMake the Case for Lightning Experience\nLightning Experience is a more intuitive and efficient interface that helps users spend less time searching for information and more time selling and solving customer problems. But the benefits go beyond a better user interface. The UI framework in the Lightning Platform empowers IT and business teams to quickly build and launch new apps and services with clicks instead of code. Which means your company has the flexibility and independence to revamp processes and features to keep up with changes in your business. Make the case for your leadership by showing how moving to Lightning Experience can realize your business goals and improve your company’s bottom line. We have some resources to help.\nCompare Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\nHere are some highlights of how Lightning Experience compares with what you’re used to in Salesforce Classic. The list includes features that are available only in Lightning Experience.\nWhat’s the Fate of Existing Salesforce Customizations?\nWe've worked hard to respect your existing customizations in Lightning Experience. Many of your point-and-click and programmatic implementations work seamlessly in the new interface. But some customizations aren’t useful or relevant in Lightning Experience. And some require updating to take advantage of all that Lightning Experience has to offer. To get a detailed analysis of your org’s customizations, run the Lightning Experience Readiness Check. In the meantime, here’s an overview of issues to consider.\nCheck Your Org’s Readiness for Lightning Experience\nAnalyze how well-prepared your org is for the transition to Lightning Experience by running the Lightning Experience Readiness Check. This tool produces a personalized Readiness Report that shows which of your users will benefit right away, and how to adjust your implementation for Lightning Experience. Most existing features and customizations just work in Lightning Experience, so you may be delighted to learn there's nothing significant to address. The report is a valuable resource that helps you focus on updates that smooth the way as you roll out Lightning Experience.\nPreview Your Org in Lightning Experience\nThis is probably the point where you’re thinking: “Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I want to see this thing.” If you’re assigned to the standard System Administrator profile, you can switch to Lightning Experience at any time. But if you don’t have access yet, the Preview feature in the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant lets you explore how your production org behaves in the new interface while you’re working in Salesforce Classic. You can see exactly how your real data, business processes, and customizations work, and you can take Lightning Experience-only features for a test drive to see how they benefit your teams. You can also use Preview to test features and customizations that the Lightning Experience Readiness Check doesn’t evaluate.\nSEE ALSO\nSupported Editions and User Licenses for Lightning Experience\nWhat are the Gaps Between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
