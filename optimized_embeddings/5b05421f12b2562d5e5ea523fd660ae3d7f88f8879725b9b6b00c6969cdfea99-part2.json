Use the Emergency Response Community site to feature different services and programs that are available to public agencies and hospitals, such as emergency supply requests. People can request permits for building access and apply for assistance programs like food delivery services. Using the mobile Inspection App field, responders can deliver emergency services quickly and efficiently. Businesses can use the site to request permits to reopen to the public. After the permit is approved, your inspector can use the Inspection App to verify that the site complies with local health and safety ordinances.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited editions.\nEmergency Response Community\n\nThe pre-configured Emergency Response Community template makes it easy for citizens to request emergency assistance and get information when they need it most.\n\nThe Emergency Response Community is a hub for your community during an emergency. Citizens and businesses can check the status of existing requests (1) or donate emergency supplies (2). Individuals and families can submit requests for assistance with temporary housing, emergency supply delivery, and wellness checks. Employees can request a permit to access a building or obtain certification for training they’ve taken (3). Businesses can request a permit to reopen to the public or request critical supplies that enable them to keep employees and customers safe (4). With Volunteer Management, you can create volunteer projects and let people sign up for shifts to help during an emergency (5). And you can add other resources to keep your community informed and protected (6).\n\nCitizens can fill out a simple online form to request supplies or delivery services. Businesses and other organizations can also request emergency supplies or reopening permits.\n\nEmergency Response Console\n\nGive your staff the power of the Emergency Response Console to triage and evaluate incoming requests from citizens or businesses.\n\nFrom the Emergency Response Console’s home page, your agency can quickly approve requests and then have a dispatcher schedule a delivery or an inspection.\n\nSalesforce Maps and the Mobile Inspection App\n\nHelp is on its way in no time when your dispatchers use Salesforce Maps.\n\nSalesforce Maps injects location intelligence into field operations to make emergency supply delivery more efficient. When an emergency event is created, the Schedule an Emergency Visit process starts a flow that creates the visit record, applies the action plan template, and creates tasks.\n\nYour field responders can complete an inspection or a delivery right on their mobile phone. Contact information, directions, and a detailed accounting of their tasks are at their fingertips. When an inspection or a delivery and the associated tasks are finished, the inspector or field responder marks the visit as complete and begins the next assignment.\n\nGrants Management\n\nGrants Management helps you launch a Grantee Portal where grant seekers can find funding opportunities. From the portal, organizations can apply for funding, view their application status, and submit ongoing progress reports for awarded grants.\n\nOnce you’ve set up Grants Management, you can create a tile in the Emergency Response site template and link to the Grantee Portal.\n\nEnable Person Accounts in Emergency Program Management\nPerson accounts store information about individuals by combining certain account and contact fields into one record. Use person accounts for personas such as individual citizens or patients.\nInstall the Emergency Program Management for Public Sector Packages\nInstall the Emergency Program Management for Public Sector packages in your org so that you can begin implementing features for your users.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
