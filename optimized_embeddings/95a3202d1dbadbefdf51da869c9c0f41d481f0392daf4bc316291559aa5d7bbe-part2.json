After you spend the budgeted money, track your spending with budget allocations that are associated with each category value.\n\nIMPORTANT If you manage budgets with many category values, avoid data skew by archiving budgets that you aren’t actively using. The number of category values is tied to the number of budgets and how many categories and periods are associated with each budget. For example, you can have a large number of category values if you have 250 budgets and one budget is associated with 170 categories and five periods. Or you can have a large number of category values if you have 1,000 budgets and each budget is associated with 17 categories and three periods.\nCreate Budget, Category, and Period Records\nSet up a budget and the budget's related records.\nEnter a Planned Budget\nEnter the details of a planned budget in one easy-to-use form.\nTrack Actual Budget Spent in Experience Cloud Site\nIn Experience Cloud, report the actual budget spent in an easy-to-use form.\nTrack Actual Budget Spent in CRM\nTo track an actual budget spent in Salesforce CRM, use budget allocations.\nCreate Budget, Category, and Period Records\n\nSet up a budget and the budget's related records.\n\nBudgets include the details about the budget—such as the start and end dates and amount or non-monetary quantity—the categories you want to budget for, and the time periods for the budget cycle.\n\nFrom the App Launcher, find and select Budget.\nCreate a budget.\nGive the budget a name and enter other details about the budget.\nSave your work.\nOn your budget record, in the Budget Category related list, click New.\nEnter details about the budget category.\nTo control the order the category appears in the budget component, enter a sequence number.
