To mitigate this situation, create a strategy to offer alternative products on your out-of-stock product detail page using B2C Commerce Einstein product recommendations. Make sure your catalog feed includes out-of-stock products to generate recommendations on an out of stock Product Detail page.\n\nMaintain good quality data about future inventory so that you aren’t offering a notification for something that is discontinued. You not only defer the sale, you also set an expectation with your potential customer that you can't deliver on. You can also include notifications only for continuity and not seasonal lines.\n\nEnsure that you have the decision criteria available to B2C Commerce only for the products that you expect to be replenished. It doesn't have to be perfect. Plans change, but if you know that forecasting online inventory is a challenge for your business, don’t use back-in-stock notifications.\n\nYou can start with a proof of concept before investing in the full Customer 360 approach discussed in this Solution Kit. Many B2C Commerce customers have built an end-to-end back-in-stock notification solution in B2C Commerce using custom objects and B2C Commerce emails. This approach doesn’t give you the level of tracking, creativity, and Customer 360 visibility of a multicloud solution. However, it gives you an idea of how effective back-in-stock notifications are.\n\nImplement This Solution\nBack-in-Stock Notification Workflow\nLearn how data flows through the configurations when you send back-in-stock notifications.\nBack-in-Stock Design Considerations\nKeep these design considerations in mind when you send back-in-stock notifications.\nIntegration Reference Implementations for Back-in-Stock Notifications\nIntegration reference implementations are developer enablement frameworks that accelerate cross-cloud integration by providing code, configuration, and implementation patterns.\nConfiguring Back-in-Stock Notifications\nUse these configurations to send back-in-stock notifications.\nSEE ALSO\nTrailhead: Salesforce Solution Kits: Quick Look\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
