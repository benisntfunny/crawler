If you change the names of the opportunity stage picklist values, make sure that the values are mapped to the correct stage type: Open, Closed/Won. or Closed/Lost.\nIf your win rate is extremely high or low, your scores could be skewed. For example, if your win rate is above 90 percent, you could get a large number of opportunities with scores above 90. To avoid skewed scores, make sure that opportunities are set to the correct closed stage. (A win rate is calculated by dividing the last two years of closed-won opportunities by all closed opportunities from that same period.)\nIf you don’t have enough opportunity data to build your own predictive model, Einstein uses a global model. The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough opportunity data, Einstein builds a scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\nAfter you turn on Einstein Opportunity Scoring, it can take up to 48 hours to analyze your data, build a scoring model, and add scores to opportunities. You can check the status from the Einstein Opportunity Scoring setup page. If Einstein is still analyzing your data after 48 hours, turn off Einstein Opportunity Scoring and then turn it on again, or edit your settings.\nDepending on when you purchased Sales Cloud Einstein, Einstein Opportunity Scoring might be on by default. If it is, scores aren’t available for opportunities that are related to a person account. To get scores on those opportunities, turn off Einstein Opportunity Scoring and then turn it on again.\nIf you don’t have any Sales Cloud Einstein licenses but your org meets specific requirements, all users with a Salesforce user license have access to scores on all opportunities. For information about your eligibility, contact Salesforce Customer Support.\nReporting\nOpportunity scores are available in standard reporting and in custom report types. Model factors, which are used to build scoring models, are available in custom report types. For examples, see Create Custom Report Types for Einstein Opportunity Scoring.\nField-Level Security\nFor each opportunity score, Einstein shows the factors that have contributed most to the score. The contributing factors that sales reps see alongside opportunity scores are dependent on the reps’ field access. For example, reps who don’t have access to the Amount field don’t see factors that are based on amount. Keep in mind that factors include only field names, not field values. For example, the Amount keeps going up factor doesn’t shows amount values to any users.\nLightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\nIn Lightning Experience, we show Not Available when there’s no score. We show Hidden when a score isn’t available because the user has limited access to opportunity scores. In Salesforce Classic , we show a blank value when there’s no score and when a score isn’t available due to limited user access. For details on why there’s no score, see Understand How Einstein Scores Your Opportunities.\nIn Lightning Experience, when you use the Opportunity Score field in any type of filtering, use null in the filter criteria (when non-numeric values are allowed) to include opportunities that Einstein hasn’t calculate a score for yet. Use -1 in the filter criteria to include opportunities that don’t have scores because of limited access to opportunity scores. In Salesforce Classic, for the same scenarios use null in the filter criteria (when non-numeric values are allowed).\nSEE ALSO\nEnable Einstein Opportunity Scoring\nEinstein Opportunity Scoring\nUnderstand How Einstein Scores Your Opportunities\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
