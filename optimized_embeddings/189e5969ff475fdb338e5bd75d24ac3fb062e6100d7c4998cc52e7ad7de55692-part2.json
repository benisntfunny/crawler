A Salesforce Payments merchant account connects to a payment gateway that handles payment processing. A payment method set is a group of payment methods that you’re willing to accept. Supported methods include credit cards, debit cards, direct debit, and digital wallets, and non-card payments methods such as SEPA and iDEAL. Each set is associated with a merchant account.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions\nTIP If you’re setting up a new D2C Commerce store, bypass this process and instead use Salesforce Checkout, a unified setup experience that uses Salesforce’s native payments, tax, and shipping services. For more information about store checkout, see Configure Checkout for a Commerce Store.\n\nWhen you first launch the Payments app from the App Launcher, the Welcome page opens. Here you can begin with the guided setup to create a merchant account and a payment method set.\n\nFollow the guided setup to create your first merchant account. The resulting merchant account gets linked to a Stripe account.\nIMPORTANT When you go to Stripe to activate your merchant account, the Stripe account that you link to must be an account established for Salesforce Payments and not a standard account that you purchased through Stripe.\nTo offer PayPal and Venmo, follow the additional setup to connect your Payments merchant account to a PayPal account. Each merchant account requires a separate PayPal business account with a unique email address. You can’t have two merchant accounts using the same PayPal account within an org.\nConfigure a payment method set by selecting payment methods your merchant account supports.\nYou can customize payment method sets for stores in specific geographies or to target specific customers. You can also assign multiple payment method sets to a merchant account to customize the payment experience for multiple stores with different payment requirements.\n\nAfter you add a Salesforce Payments merchant account, you can view the account from the Payments app Settings page. All your merchant accounts are listed.\n\nTo see more details and complete actions for your merchant account, select the account name. Each account shows account status.\n\nComplete—You provided all the required account information, and your merchant account is now active and ready to process payments.\nEnabled—The account is in good standing, although the gateway can ask you for more information in the future. If you don't provide the information, the account can become restricted. The time limit that you have to provide the information is longer than the Restricted Soon state.\nRejected— The payment provider rejected the account.\nRestricted—Account payouts or payments are disabled so the merchant account’s capabilities are limited. Provide more information to the gateway to enable the account.\nRestricted Soon—The account has a due date for providing additional information to the payment gateway. If you don’t provide the information in a specific time period, the account becomes restricted.\n\nFrom the account’s Related tab, you can view and edit a payment method set.\n\nTo add more merchant accounts, go to the Payment’s app Settings page and click Add Account.\n\nAdd Merchant Accounts for Different Geographies\nThe first time you launch the Payments app, you add a merchant account. If your business operates in a variety of geographies, you can add a merchant account for each geography. Add a merchant account from the Settings page of the Payment app.\nAdd a Payment Method Set to a Store Checkout Page\nControl the payment options shown to customers at checkout by adding the Salesforce Payments Experience Builder component to your B2B or D2C store checkout page.\nSEE ALSO\nCommerce Checkout\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
