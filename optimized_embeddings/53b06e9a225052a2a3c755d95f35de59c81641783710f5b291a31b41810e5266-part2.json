A census may be used in quoting and rating as well as the subsequent enrollment process.\n\nVlocity has a deep set of features to manage and uploadUploading Census Data Overview censuses for small and large group health plans. This topic covers the census data model and how it is used within Vlocity for census related features.\n\nCensus Data Model\n\nVlocity has two custom census objects: Census and Census Member.\n\nThe Census object (GroupCensus__c) provides a snapshot of statistics about members of a group (that is to say, employees) and their legal dependents. A census may be used in quoting and rating as well as the enrollment process. It is a master-detail child object of an Employer/Group Account.\n\nThe Census Member object (GroupCensusMember__c) represents specific personal information about a member or a dependent and is used by an insurance company to estimate the health care costs for the group. It is a master-detail child object of the Group Census.\n\nThe Census object has two Record Types, for Small Group and Large Group plans, which are based on the number of employees enrolled in a plan.\n\nThe Census object's Type field (CensusType__c) defines the census under one of the following categories:\n\nSystem—A System census maintains the active membership of a census. It can be updated regularly as required. A System census is used by Vlocity services for specific business processes. For example, the getContractDetailInsContractService: getContractDetail service can pull the system census for a group to generate a renewal quote. Note that Vlocity expects that a group will have only one active System census at any given time.\n\nQuote —This type of census is attached to a quote and can be locked down from edits so you have a record of the membership that was used to generate a quote. It can be uploaded by a user or cloned from a System census for the quote process. It can also be used during group onboarding and enrollment to compare it against the membership that was used to generate the quote.\n\nEnrollment—An Enrollment census defines all the members that the enrollment will be offered to as well as their dependents. It is attached to the contract, and allows you to maintain an enrollment census apart from the active membership so you can analyze yearly changes, as well as segments of memberships for specific contracts.\n\nCensus Member Records\n\nAll employees and their dependents (spouse, children) have census member records. The census member records form family Groups, with the employee being the primary member of the group and all dependents who are related to that primary member. \n\nHere's a simple example of a family of three, with an employee (Mary), spouse (John), and child (Kyle), and the associated census fields for this particular setup:\n\nThe employee, Mary, is designated as the primary census member (true) and John and Kyle's primary fields are appropriately set to false. Note that the Primary Census Member Id for a spouse and any dependents is equal to the Record Id of the primary member, as shown.\n\nCensus Roll-up Summary Fields\n\nThe Census object also has several roll-up summary fields used to count family tiers, as well as roll-up other employee and family numbers. \n\nNOTE\n\nA roll-up summary field calculates values from related records, such as those in a related list. You can create a roll-up summary field to display a value in a master record based on the values of fields in a detail record.\n\nThese are the roll-up fields for the Census object:\n\nTIP\n\nYou can add your own roll-up fields to alter the formulas for rate band tieringRate Bands and Rate Tiers or to define any other business need that's part of your census count process.\n\nConverting Leads to Census\n\nThe InsCensusService: convertLeadAndCreateCensusInsCensusService: convertLeadAndCreateCensus service can be used in an OmniScript to create Census objects from Leads.\n\nThe service uses two objects, InsuredGroupCensus__c and InsuredGroupCensusMember__c, to capture group and individual census members, respectively, at the lead stage.\n\nRead all about it in Convert Leads and Create a Census.\n\nUploading Census Data Overview\nAfter you add a Group, you're ready to upload census data for the group members using census records.\nUploading a Census from the Census Uploader\nSales reps, group admins, or insurance brokers use the spreadsheet Census Uploader to upload a census file to Vlocity. In addition to member and dependent data (name, birthdate), this file can also include product enrollment information (medical, dental, vision).\nProduct Enrollment Data with a Census\nYou can upload product enrollment data (medical, dental, vision) with census members, either via OmniScript or spreadsheet.\nIntegrate Census Data with Rating Facts Specs\nRating Fact Specs, like Coverage Specs and Insured Item Specs, contain attributes that can be used to calculate a rating when added to product specs. For small group health products, census and census member data also goes into the rating calculation. You can configure a Rating Facts Spec as a master spec for all census and census member field mappings and then reuse that spec across all products in one or more product categories.\nConvert Leads and Create a Census\nThe convertLeadAndCreateCensusInsCensusService: convertLeadAndCreateCensus service extends the Salesforce Lead Conversion feature specifically for Leads that have a census. The service converts the Lead to an Account and maps the Lead census data to the Vlocity Group Account Census.\nCensus Services\nThere are a number of census specific services that are part of the InsCensusService class.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
