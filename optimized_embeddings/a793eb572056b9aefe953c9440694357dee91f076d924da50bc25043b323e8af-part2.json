And understand what your users need for a positive, productive experience. These criteria make it clear which MFA verification methods you must support in your implementation.\n\nHere are some questions and potential requirements to consider.\n\nExisting Authentication Solutions\t\n\nDoes your company use an existing MFA solution, like Okta or Duo, for other systems? If your Salesforce users are already using MFA to log in to other applications, see if you can integrate your Salesforce products with the same solution. Doing so can reduce your timeline and costs for implementing MFA. And it can minimize friction and change management needs because users are already trained for MFA logins.\n\nAre your Salesforce products integrated with an SSO solution? If you use SSO for Salesforce logins, ensure that MFA is enabled for all your Salesforce users.\n\nFor products built on the Salesforce Platform, use the MFA functionality provided in Salesforce or use your SSO provider’s MFA service.\nFor all other Salesforce products, use your SSO provider’s MFA service.\n\nSecurity Requirements\tWork with your security and IT teams to understand how MFA aligns with your company’s security objectives and requirements. Understand if any enterprise mandates are in place, and what kinds of application testing or evaluation processes you must follow.\nLegal and Regulatory Requirements\t\n\nWhat are your company’s legal commitments to customers and other stakeholders around how your users authenticate to your systems?\n\nAlso consider local and other regulatory requirements and how they can impact your MFA implementation. For example, some regulatory requirements include restrictions on downloading applications to certain devices.\n\n\nCompliance Requirements\tWhat kinds of audit requirements does an MFA implementation affect or trigger? Are you beginning any new compliance regimes in the next 12 months that your MFA project can affect?\nDevice Requirements\t\n\nConsider if your industry’s or company’s mobile device policies place any constraints on your MFA implementation. For example, does a mobile app-based solution work or must you provide your users with physical security keys?\n\nIf mobile apps are an option, does your company provide corporate devices? Or must you integrate MFA data usage and reimbursement guidelines into your Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy?\n\n\nUser Considerations\t\n\nUnderstand how MFA can impact the various roles and teams at your company. For example:\n\nDo any of your users travel or work from locations with limited connectivity?\nDo you have any users, such as third-party call center agents or employees with accessibility requirements, who have special requirements or restrictions regarding verification methods?\nWhich verification methods are the least intrusive to your users’ workflow?\n\nWe recommend supporting multiple verification methods in your implementation, so each person can choose the option that works best for them.\n\n\nBudget Considerations\t\n\nIt’s useful to factor in the cost of doing an MFA implementation, as well as the budget needed for post-rollout operational and user support functions.\n\nSalesforce products provide MFA at no extra cost, and the Salesforce Authenticator app is free. But if a mobile app option doesn’t work for some or all users, account for the expense to purchase and distribute security keys.\n\nUse Requirements to Define Your MFA Implementation\n\nWhen you’ve identified your requirements and understand your users’ needs, use these criteria to decide which verification methods to include in your MFA implementation. We know that your users and use cases are diverse, so we support several different types of strong verification methods.\n\nTIP You can standardize on one type of method that everyone uses, or you can support multiple options and let users choose. Consider the tradeoffs when deciding the approach to take. When everyone uses the same method, it simplifies your onboarding and day-to-day administration responsibilities. But letting users pick what works best for them eliminates the need for a one-size-fits-all solution. And it’s easier to meet all of your requirements. Plus, users are less likely to get locked out of Salesforce if they can set up multiple verification methods for themselves.\nSEE ALSO\nPlan Your Multi-Factor Authentication Rollout\nVerification Methods for Multi-Factor Authentication\nUse Salesforce MFA for SSO\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
