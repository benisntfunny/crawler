    "content": "nullAbout the Salesforce Known Issues Site\nPublish Date: Jul 22, 2023\nDescription\n\n\nThe Salesforce Known Issues site complements trust.salesforce.com and enhances both trust and customer success through visibility into Salesforce platform Known Issues.\n\nResolution\nOverview\n\nWhat is Known Issues?\n\nKnown Issues is Salesforce’s bug transparency site where we publicly share the status of our software defects. Instead of contacting support, Known Issues helps you find relevant and up-to-date information about our technology bugs, including workarounds that may be available.\n\nRelated to Salesforce Known Issues is Salesforce Trust, which highlights outages and issues with our servers. If you’re experiencing service-level issues with your Salesforce technology, please check out the Trust website.\n\nWhat’s new with Known Issues?\n\nIn 2023, we delivered a reimagined Known Issues experience. Here are some of the changes we’ve made to help improve the site:\nIntelligent Search: New multi-select filters and keyword search enable you to quickly find Known Issues that may be relevant to you.\nKnown Issue Details: View easy-to-read Known Issue records, which include created dates and last updated dates driven by status.\nConfigurable Status Change Notifications: Within your Trailblazer profile, choose the relevant status change emails to stay looped in on pertinent updates.\nEnhanced Tracking: Leverage the new My Known Issues search filter to keep tabs on Known Issues you’ve reported impact you or your business.\n\nWebsite Information\n\nHow are Known Issues created?\n\nIf you’re having trouble with your Salesforce technology and can’t find an existing Known Issue, contact support. From there, support will investigate the problem and work with our product teams to determine if it’s a bug that may impact multiple customers and post it publicly on the Known Issues site.\n\nWhat do Known Issue statuses mean?\n\nSalesforce product teams convey any progress made towards resolving or, in some cases, not resolving a given Known Issue through statuses, which are defined below:\nIn Review: Product teams are gathering information to shape next steps. This is the default status for all new Known Issues.\nSolution in Progress: Product teams are actively working to resolve the issue.\nSolution Scheduled: Product teams have implemented a solution to the issue and scheduled it for an upcoming release.\nSolution Deploying: A solution to the issue has been released on some instances (i.e., sandbox instances first, then production instances).\nSolution Deployed: A solution to the issue has been released on all instances (i.e., both sandbox and production instances have the solution).\nWorking as Expected: Product teams don’t plan to resolve the issue because documentation indicates that it isn’t a bug. If you’d like Salesforce to still consider working on this piece of work, please post an idea on the IdeaExchange.\nClosed: Product teams are no longer actively working to resolve the issue. This is typically due to a low level of customer impact, competing priorities, or technological blockers.\n\nWhat should I do if a Known Issue impacts me or my business?\n\nWhen a Known Issue impacts you or your business, click the Report button. These reports are collected on an individual level and help Salesforce product teams prioritize which bugs they work on first. You may click the Report button on as many Known Issues as you want, but you can only log one report per Known Issue.\n\nHow can I track Known Issues that impact me?\n\nClicking the Report button on a Known Issue automatically subscribes you to it. By default, you’ll receive status change email notifications for all Known Issues you’ve reported impact you. You can control these preferences in your Trailblazer profile. If you want to review the Known Issues you’re tracking on your own time, use the My Known Issues search page filter.\n\nHow can I control my email notifications?\n\nIf you’d like to reduce the number of Known Issues notifications you receive, you can:\nRemove your Report selection from specific Known Issues, or\nConfigure your email preferences on the settings tab of your Trailblazer profile*\n*Within your Trailblazer profile, you can choose which notifications you’d like to receive. By default, you’ll receive all status change email notifications (sent from noreply-knownissues@salesforce.com) for Known Issues you’ve reported impact you. Use the toggles to decide when you want to be notified via email. To mute all status change email notifications, disable every toggle.\n\nWhat do the instances mean?\n\nAt Salesforce, our releases are staggered, meaning that we don’t deploy code changes to every environment at once. During the first four to six weeks of a major release, we push changes to sandbox instances first, to allow you to test, and then deploy to production. Learn more about the Salesforce release processes in the Prepare for Salesforce Releases Trail.\n\nWe display instances for all Known Issues in the Solution Deploying status to let you know where the solution for that particular Known Issue has been deployed. That way you can test out the solution in your sandbox environment before it is applied to production.\n\nWhen will Salesforce resolve a Known Issue that impacts me?\n\nWe wish our product teams could resolve every Known Issue. However, Salesforce product managers have to balance resolving our software bugs with delivering new innovative experiences for you.\n\nMultiple factors influence the speed at which Salesforce product teams resolve Known Issues, such as priority, report count, technical complexity, and release schedules. Time to resolution varies between each Known Issue and product team.\n\nHelp & Troubleshooting\n\nWhat can I do if I need help with the Known Issues site?\n\nThere are few ways you can get the answers you need regarding Known Issues:\nGo through standard support channels. This should be your first stop for any troubleshooting or inquiries.\nIf you’re having trouble logging in with your Trailblazer account, check out this article.\nConnect with the Known Issues team through the Known Issues group on the Trailblazer Community.\n\nWho do I contact if I have more information about Known Issues that may help Salesforce?\n\n\nWe’re so grateful for our Salesforce community’s drive to make Salesforce better for everyone. If you have additional information about a Known Issue that would be helpful to Salesforce and the broader community, please contact support.\n\nKnowledge Article Number\n\n000386216\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
