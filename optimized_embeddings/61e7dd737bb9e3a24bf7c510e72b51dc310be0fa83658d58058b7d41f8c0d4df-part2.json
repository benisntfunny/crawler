All users with a Chatter-enabled permission set have access to Chatter, even if Chatter isn't enabled in their user profile.\nWhen you disable Chatter in a permission set, the permission set doesn't take precedence over user profile settings. All users with a Chatter-enabled user profile have access to Chatter, even if Chatter is disabled in their permission set. To prevent that person from accessing Chatter, disable Chatter in both the person's user profile and permission set.\nWhen Chatter profile-based rollout is enabled for an org, Chatter is automatically enabled when some user-level permissions are already enabled. And some Chatter settings are disabled. For more information, see Profile-Based Rollout Considerations.\n\nVerify that existing permission sets include the correct and required Chatter permissions for the desired subset of users.\n\nIn Setup, navigate to Permission Sets.\nFor each existing user-level permission set:\nIn the System section, click System Permissions.\nClick Edit, and select Enable Chatter. The Enable Chatter permission is available in a permission set only after Chatter profile-based rollout is enabled for your org.\nSave your changes.\nIf applicable, create permission sets with the desired permissions and assign them to users. By default, all permissions in a new permission set are disabled. Enable the appropriate permissions in the new permission set to give users access to Chatter plus extra levels of management authority.\nCreate and Own New Chatter Groups (ChatterOwnGroups)—Users with this permission can create groups in Chatter.\nCreate and Share Content Deliveries for Chatter Files (ChatterFileLink)—Users with this permission can use files with Chatter, like uploading, attaching, and sharing.\nInvite Customers To Chatter (ChatterInviteExternalUsers)—Users with this permission can invite users who don’t have a Salesforce license to Chatter.\nManage Chatter Messages and Direct Messages (ManageChatterMessages)—Users with this permission have management access to Chatter Messages and Direct Messages (Experience Builder sites).\nModerate Chatter (ModerateChatter)—Users with this permission can moderate Chatter feeds.\nModerate Chatter Feeds (ModerateNetworkFeeds)—Users with this permission can moderate feeds in sites.\nUse Case Feed (ViewCaseInteraction)—Users with this permission can access Case feeds.\nView All Data (ViewAllData)—Users with this permission can view all data, regardless of their membership status in a feed or ownership of a record.\nNOTE Selecting the Enable Chatter permission in a person's permission set doesn't automatically turn on Chatter for that person. People can't use Chatter until you turn on Chatter for your organization.\nSEE ALSO\nGet Ready for Profile-Based Rollout of Chatter\nControl Chatter Access Through User Profiles\nChatter Settings\nProfile-Based Rollout Considerations\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
