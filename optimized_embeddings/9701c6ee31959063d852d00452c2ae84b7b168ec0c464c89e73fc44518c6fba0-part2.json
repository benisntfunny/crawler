A measure identifies the source object, related objects, fields, field values, and logic that you want to associate with a particular activity you want to track. Measures and programs are separate objects in Salesforce so that you can define a measure one time and then reuse it across multiple programs or use it multiple times in one program. To help you get started, some prebuilt measures are available, or you can create measures from scratch.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nPrebuilt Enablement Measures\nTo help you get started with Enablement measures, some prebuilt measures are available and define criteria for completing some typical outcomes and milestones. Review the use cases, criteria, and applicable prerequisites for each prebuilt measure. Some prebuilt measures are available to start using right away, but others require extra setup, including measures that use Einstein Conversation Insights (ECI). In Program Builder, templates for programs that sales users take in Lightning Experience reference prebuilt measures.\nConsiderations for Creating and Editing Measures\nSee how to customize prebuilt measures without affecting program templates. Learn how to avoid negatively affecting program analytics when you edit measures. And review what to expect if you attempt to build a measure for an object that you don’t have access to.\nGuidelines for Creating Einstein Conversation Insights Measures for Conversation-Based Goals\nTo add conversation-based goals to your Enablement programs using voice and video calls recorded with Einstein Conversation Insights (ECI), create a measure that uses ECI objects. Learn guidelines for building successful ECI measures, such as which parameters are required. Also, get ideas for incorporating ECI Call Insights into your programs, such as counting key phrases that call owners mention during their customer calls.\nCreate and Activate Enablement Measures\nCreate measures that align with your company’s processes for tracking job-related activities. Specify the criteria for the object and fields that satisfy the activity you want to measure for Enablement program outcomes and milestones. Activate measures you create so that they’re available for use in programs.\nClone Enablement Measures\nAdd measures quickly by cloning measures that are already created and modifying the cloned measures. Cloning measures is recommended for modifying prebuilt measures that come with the Enablement add-on license. You can clone valid measures from the Enablement Measures page regardless of the measure’s status. The cloned measures retain all details from the original measures.\nEnablement Measures Examples\nFind inspiration for creating Enablement measures that track job-related activity for your Enablement program outcomes and milestones. For some examples, a Salesforce admin must set up other features or create custom objects, fields, or picklists. Some examples offer There can be multiple ways to track the same behavior or goal, so you can consider multiple options. To further refine the specific activity that a measure tracks, combine field filters from multiple examples\nResolving Access to Enablement Measures Objects and Fields\nSometimes Enablement admins can’t access objects, fields, or fields values when creating or editing measures. This scenario can happen when profiles, permission sets, or sharing settings restrict access or when the objects or fields are deleted or renamed.\nSEE ALSO\nOutcomes, Milestones, and Measures\nPrebuilt Enablement Measures\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
