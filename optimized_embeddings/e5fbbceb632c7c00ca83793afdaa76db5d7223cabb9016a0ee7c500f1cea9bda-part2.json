Drive revenue growth with sales programs in Lightning Experience or build brand loyalty in your Partner Relationship Management (PRM) site, built with Experience Cloud.

Create programs that are unique to your products, services, or processes and track progress that users make toward measurable milestones and outcomes.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nFull Enablement is available with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nEnablement Lite is available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\nPartner Enablement is available with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions. A supported PRM add-on license is required.\nEnablement Rollout Guide\nBuild, launch, and track Enablement programs that help your company’s sales reps achieve revenue outcomes and that grow your business with partner engagement and loyalty.\nDriving Business Outcomes with Enablement\nEnablement teams can build and launch programs that drive the business outcomes most important to your company. Enablement analytics let teams prove the effectiveness of their enablement strategy and iterate on it over time with automated progress tracking.\nEnablement Data Model\nEnablement objects define measures, programs, and program items (also called program tasks), such as outcomes, milestones, and exercises. These objects also track progress that users make through a program and its items.\nSetting Up Enablement\nBefore you can start creating and completing Enablement programs, Salesforce admins must complete some setup steps. Review Enablement roles and assign appropriate permissions for building and completing programs. For sales programs in Lightning Experience, you can set up Einstein Conversation Insights (ECI) so that Enablement admins can add conversation-based outcomes and milestones.\nSales Program Templates\nWith Enablement Lite and full Enablement, you can create sales programs in Lightning Experience quickly by choosing from program templates. Check out the list of the available templates and review specific requirements for each template’s outcome and milestones.\nBuilding Enablement Measures\nEnablement measures specify the job-related activity that correspond to outcomes and milestones in Enablement programs. A measure identifies the source object, related objects, fields, field values, and logic that you want to associate with a particular activity you want to track. Measures and programs are separate objects in Salesforce so that you can define a measure one time and then reuse it across multiple programs or use it multiple times in one program. To help you get started, some prebuilt measures are available, or you can create measures from scratch.\nDesigning Enablement Programs\nFor all program types, you can design and assemble your own Enablement program from start to finish. Build Enablement milestones, add your exercise content, and organize your program in Program Builder. Review considerations and guidelines along the way.\nManaging Partner Enablement Programs\nShow Partner Enablement programs to partner users in supported Experience Cloud sites as part of your Partner Relationship Management (PRM) strategy. Partner Enablement programs are also called Partner Tracks. Work with your site developer to build partner experiences that show Enablement programs, outcomes, milestones, and exercises in site pages where partners interact with your brand.\nLaunching Enablement Programs\nAfter you develop programs and measures in a sandbox, deploy them to production. Make Enablement programs available to users by publishing programs, assigning programs to users directly, and sharing programs so uses can self-enroll.\nTake Enablement Programs\nYou can take Enablement programs when an Enablement admin assigns you to a program or shares a program with you for self-enrollment. Take an assigned program starting at 12 AM on the start date, or take a self-enrolled program anytime after you enroll.\nTracking Enablement Program Progress\nSee how users are performing against an Enablement program’s outcomes, milestones, and exercises. Prebuilt dashboards and reports provide insights to help you analyze how well Enablement programs are changing behaviors and improving business outcomes.\nMaintaining Enablement Programs\nManage the quality of your Enablement programs over time. You can clone existing programs, remove users, unpublish programs, or edit programs you already published.\nEnablement Limits\nWhen creating Enablement measures, creating Enablement programs, and making programs available to users, keep limits for measures, programs, and enrollment in mind.\nSupported Languages for Enablement\nMost features for creating and taking Enablement programs are available in all languages that Salesforce supports. But some records, content, and other items support only one language.\nSEE ALSO\nTrailhead: Sales Programs and Partner Tracks Basics\nTrailblazer Community Group: Sales Programs Powered by Enablement\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
