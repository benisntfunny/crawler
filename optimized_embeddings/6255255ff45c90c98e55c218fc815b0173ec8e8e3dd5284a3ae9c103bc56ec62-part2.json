There’s a lot to choose from, so start with the features that best benefit the users in the current rollout group. Then keep iterating over time to add even more value.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nHere are some great candidates to consider.\n\nFEATURE\tDESCRIPTION\nActivity Timeline\tGive users an easier, more efficient way to keep track of current and past activities. All the key details for each task, meeting, logged call, and sent email are bundled together, right on the page with other record details.\nShared Activities\tRepresent activity relationships more accurately by letting your sales reps relate multiple contacts to individual events and tasks. Shared Activities is forever. After the feature’s enabled, it can’t be disabled.\nEnhanced Notes\tHelp your users stay organized with our enhanced note-taking tool. It’s a breeze to create rich-text notes and quickly relate them to specific records. When you turn on Enhanced Notes, remember to add the new Notes related list to page layouts. Adding the Notes related list lets your users create and read notes directly from their records.\nSalesforce Files\tUse the rich features and flexibility of Salesforce Files from standard Salesforce objects and your custom objects. Add the new Files related list to page layouts. Adding the Files related list lets users upload files to records, see files associated with records, and quickly page through files in the visually rich preview player.\nPath\tTo work more efficiently or close more deals, help your users adopt your company’s processes. Set up a process based on an object’s status or stage. Add guidance for success at each step in the process.\nNews\tGive your reps instant access to relevant, timely news about their accounts, contacts, leads, and opportunities. This feature is available only in English, so if your org uses a different primary language, consider whether you want this option.\nHome Page\tGive your users everything they need to manage their day from the Lightning Experience Home page. Sales reps can see their quarterly performance summary and get important updates on critical tasks and opportunities. You can also customize the page for different types of users and assign custom pages for different profiles.\nDuplicate Management\tTo alert users when they’re about to create a duplicate record, create duplicate rules. Duplicate rules establish whether and when users can create duplicate records in Salesforce.\nLead Conversion\tKeep the sales process moving by letting your sales reps convert qualified leads to contacts. At the time of conversion, sales reps select an account for the newly created contact, or create an account if it’s not yet in Salesforce. Reps can also create an opportunity on the spot. Add the Convert button to the Lead page layout.\nLightning Apps\tHelp users work more efficiently by giving them access to all the data and tools they need. What’s most important to sales reps? Accounts, events, and organizations. How about sales managers? Reports and dashboards make the top of the list. Lightning apps take things to another level past Classic apps by letting you brand your apps with a custom color, logo, and utility bar.\nLightning Console Apps\tHave users in fast-paced environments like call centers or contact centers? Console apps are perfect for these situations. Users can view multiple records and their related records on the same screen, and quickly work through records from a list using split view. It’s easy to jump back-and-forth between lists and records without losing track of what you’re working on.\nSEE ALSO\nLightning Experience Roadmap\nLightning Experience Exclusive Features\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
