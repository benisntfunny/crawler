Enterprise 2.0 customers can contact an account executive to enable additional features, such as business unit filters.\n\nAudiences\n\nAn audience represents a collection of contacts that are grouped based on attributes that are used when they receive a message. An audience draws information from a sendable data extension. Audience Builder sets a flag in the header of the data extension noting it as an audience. Outbound Mail Manager (OMM) uses this information to determine which channel, audience, and segment engaged the contact with a message.\n\nYou can publish an audience for use in a send or other activities.\n\nAudience Builder can use any lists, groups, or data extensions linked through a common subscriber key or ID. You can add attributes to Audience Builder without adding more dimensions to them. Audience Builder only supports queries performed via the expression builder.\n\nNOTE We recommend using a subscriber key with Audience Builder. You can implement Audience Builder to use the email address as the customer key.\n\nTo send an email via Marketing Cloud Engagement, use the audience data extension template. When sending to the audience object, subscriber behavior is tracked in the template. Audience Builder also supports other channels, such as mobile and social.\n\nYou can use audiences for suppression with user-initiated and wizard-based sending tools.\n\nAudiences can include ID and code values:\n\nIDs and Codes represent distinct entities.\nAudience Builder requires IDs. Codes represent optional values.\nIDs uniquely identify the audience object.\nIDs help reporting and tracking activities. Use these values to manage audiences and segments.\nThe Summary screen lists a field labeled Audience ID that actually displays a code value.\nCodes don’t require unique values. You can use any applicable value as a code.\nCodes help manage or associate an audience with a campaign.\n\nAudience Builder lists activities in Automation Studio under Data Factory and the Audience Builder Folder. To pick an audience to refresh, use the Build Audience activity.\n\nSegments\n\nA segment represents a group of people who meet a set of user-defined criteria. Use segments for analysis and for targeting in an audience. If you choose not to add a filter, Audience Builder builds segments using the entire available population of contacts from your account. Audiences don’t require segments or audience filters.\n\nYou can append attributes to segments in the Publish tab. Appending attributes to segments associates contact content with a segment. Also, you can use AMPscript and Server-Side JavaScript to power a content decision in email. The action is based on a contact’s segment assignment in a specific audience.\n\nReporting\n\nYou can use audiences and segments for reporting. Audience Builder provides a report in the standard email reports section that breaks down the campaign metrics by segment name.\n\nPerformance\n\nEvery Audience Builder implementation has unique performance characteristics. Work with your implementation team to understand performance expectations.\n\nAll systems that process more instructions take longer to complete, but this operation can occur many times faster than a standard query.\n\nWe recommend one refresh of Audience Builder data per day. The refresh updates lists and data extensions.\n\nEnterprise Accounts\n\nAudience Builder limits the number of values per dimension to under 1,000. You can use attributes with more than 100 values. Also, you can manage the total at the enterprise, such as 100 dimensions in business unit A and 100 dimensions in business unit B. With this method, despite the same number of dimensions in both business units, the dimensions aren’t from the same dataset. By using the custom attribute selectors, such as starts with, ends with, contains, greater than, and less than, users can access all the values stored in the attribute and use that for criteria in a selection.\n\nGet Started with Audience Builder\nAudience Builder dynamically creates targeted audiences from contacts stored in your account based on stored attribute and behavioral values. Use these audiences to either target or exclude contacts from activities in Marketing Cloud Engagement.\nFilter Tab\nThe Filter tab in Audience Builder allows you to take your total population and query it to match the subscriber data of interest. Filter an audience either for send purposes, such as sending emails to specific subscribers that match your query target. You can also filter for analytic purposes, such as examining the number of subscribers that match a given criteria.\nExclusions Tab\nUse the Exclusions tab in Audience Builder to create suppression criteria from your attribute library. You can then remove a subset of contacts from a filtered audience or segment.\nSegment Tab\nSegment an audience in Audience Builder to suppress certain subscribers from either your total population or a filtered population.\nAudience Publishing\nAfter you filter and segment your audience in Audience Builder, you can publish your audience as a publish definition. Publish definitions represent data extensions containing the filter and segment data you defined in the audience. Use publish definitions across the Marketing Cloud in other applications. Access your published definition in the Audience data extension folder, located in Email Studio under the Subscribers tab.\nDimension Packages\nDimension packages describe the way you use Audience Builder to interact with the subscriber data in Marketing Cloud Engagement. Dimension packages translate raw subscriber attributes into readable information in your Attribute Library. Use this information to build and segment audiences.\nAudience Builder for Administrators\nA Marketing Cloud Engagement admin can manage user access to Audience Builder attributes, existing dimensions, and segment templates.\nAudience Builder Attribute Library\nUse the Attribute Library in Audience Builder to drag subscriber criteria onto the canvas as you filter or segment your audience. The Attribute Library displays raw subscriber data as readable attribute labels. The data that appears in the Attribute Library depends on the Data Packages in your Marketing Cloud Engagement org.\nAudience Builder Scenarios\nReview these Audience Builder scenarios for examples on how to use this Marketing Cloud Engagement feature. These scenarios use sample data that doesn’t always match your own data.\nAudiences and Segments\nThese diagrams show the relationship between audience filters and segments in Audience Builder for Marketing Cloud Engagement.\nOperator Use Cases\nWhen you define and segment your audience in Audience Builder, work with operators to change the logic of your expressions.\nPublish an Audience to Salesforce Data Extension Folder\nPublish an audience of your subscribers to the Salesforce data extension folder so that you can use a user-initiated Salesforce send. Marketing Cloud Engagement receives only subscriber tracking data that’s returned from Salesforce. Subscribers without a Salesforce ID can’t send data back to Salesforce.\nAutomation Studio Activities for Audience Builder\nYou can increase productivity in Marketing Cloud Engagement when you use a combination of tools. Audience Builder actions are available as activities in Automation Studio and are related to an Email Studio program. Add one or more activities to an automation to accomplish your tasks.\nSupported Characters for Audience Builder\nAudience Builder supports these characters for the specified locations.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
