You can plan visits for your sales reps and assign tasks to be performed in a visit. Salesforce Maps help you to create optimized routes for your field reps. And with the CRM Analytics app, you can increase sales, improve store compliance, identify stores at risk, and maximize field reps’ effectiveness. You can also use Salesforce Surveys to get insights about your business from channel partners.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in Lightning Experience in Professional, Unlimited, and Enterprise Editions that have Consumer Goods Cloud enabled.\nAccounts and Contacts in Retail Execution\nUse accounts to store information about customers or individuals you do business with. Use contacts to store information about the people you do business with. Contacts are associated with accounts, and each retail store in an account can have a different primary contact.\nManage Your Stores Efficiently\nSimplify the way you track stores, in-store locations, and the products sold in these stores by grouping. Managing large numbers of individual stores, in-store locations, and products can be time consuming and confusing. It’s hard to track which products are sold in which stores and where products are placed in each store. Grouping creates smaller numbers of store groups, in-store location categories, and assortments, making it easy to manage.\nAssign a Vehicle to a Rep\nStreamline store deliveries by creating vehicle-user assignments for reps. When a vehicle-user assignment is active, no other assignment involving that vehicle or user can be activated. Also, you can add product inventories for vehicles to let reps know the exact inventory. The information about the product inventories help reps meet ad hoc requests from a store.\nPromotions\nPromotions play a significant role in increasing product sales. Promotions can be a part of a larger campaign to spread awareness about a new product or can be a part of a targeted objective.\nPlanogram Set Up\nProduct placement plays a critical role in attracting consumer attention. Examine the planogram task details, add a reference image, and associate the planogram with an in-store location.\nSurveys\nCreate engaging, easy-to-use surveys with a simple editor to collect feedback and information from your users or customers. You can select different types of questions to gather the data that suits your needs. After you add a question, specify the responses that participants can choose.\nAssessment Indicator Definition\nDuring a visit, you capture store data and measure store performance by using a set of parameters that are defined by using the Assessment Indicator Definitions. For example, the count of a product on a shelf, or a product facing on a shelf. You can associate an Assessment Indicator Definition (AID) with one or more assessment task types such as Product, Product Category, Promotion, Planogram, and Custom on the mobile app.\nRetail Store KPI\nIn Retail Store KPIs, you can define the assessment indicator definition that must be captured for a store group. Because the assessment indicator definition is associated with assessment task definition and store groups to stores, Retail Store KPIs are the link between a store and the tasks to be performed at a store. You can also define the expected values of an assessment indicator definition in Retail Store KPIs.\nAssessment Task Definition\nWhile on a store visit, field reps perform certain activities related to the different aspects of retail execution. You can define these activities as assessment task definitions. Assessment Task definition holds information such as name, description, category, and type of task.\nAction Plan Template\nAction plan template is a reusable framework that you can use to schedule visits where the set of activities to be performed in each visit remains constant.\nGet Task Recommendations\nSales managers plan and schedule tasks for visits. To maximize profits and deliver brand value, it’s important to create the right tasks for a visit. Einstein Visit Task Recommendation helps you identify the tasks and the assessment indicator definitions that can be performed on a visit. With a single click, you can schedule tasks and assessment indicator definitions recommended by Einstein. Or, you can choose to review the list and schedule only the most important tasks and assessment indicator definitions.\nTeam Supervisors’ Roles & Responsibilities\nMonitor and track the activities of your sales reps to achieve your team’s sales objectives. Provide guidance to improve a rep’s performance and ensure greater customer satisfaction. Plan the store visits of your sales reps, create store-related job lists, and assign activities to your sales reps.\nActivities\nActivity is a list of questions or surveys that sales reps can answer during store visits. Depending on the visit template added, activities get automatically added to visits that are created using these templates, saving you time and effort. You can also add products and customers to an activity to quickly make the activity available to the products and the customers.\nVisit\nA visit is an act where a field rep goes to a retail store and performs certain tasks.\nSubstitution Management\nWith Substitution Management, you can maintain service continuity for customers in the absence of reps who handle the account. Define substitutes for sales reps for specific periods and for specific customers. The substitute performs key operations for the unavailable reps’ customers.\nDaily Reports\nSales reps and supervisors can use daily reports to analyze, track, and monitor all field rep activities. Daily reports track the productive time spent on customer visits, research, and sales, and the downtime spent on breaks, vacation, and private appointments. Use daily reports to improve productivity by tracking the time spent on customer visits. Sales reps can use Visit Calendar to create and maintain daily and weekly visits, and update the daily reports for productive and downtime visits.\nUser Tasks\nTo ensure that you don’t miss either a to-do or personal action, create a user task record. You can create a task, view and filter a list of assigned tasks, and change the status of a task.\nCreate a Customer Task\nYou can create a task for a customer only if you’re either a supervisor in a customer team or a manager of a customer. Create tasks for a customer by using a customer task template that's assigned to the customer.\nAsset Management\nAssets are items, such as refrigerators or freezers that you place at a retail store or customer location to increase your sales. As an asset’s owner, you’re responsible for the maintenance, repair, and other services required for the asset. Efficient management of assets can reduce customer complaints and, in turn, increase your brand value. By actively tracking your assets’ conditions, you can budget better, reduce losses, and ensure employee safety.\nSales Agreements\nSales agreements enable you to plan your sales and operations better. They can help make your business transaction, profits, and revenue margins more predictable.\nSalesforce Maps\nWith data in a map-based interface, you can visualize and track stores in your territories. Give your field reps the visit routes with minimum travel time and also ensure that the right stores are visited at the right time.\nSignatures\nAdmins can configure the signature flow for an object with relevant signatures from multiple roles using signature templates. For example, a signature flow that requires a signature from the store manager followed by the signature from the sales rep. Customize the signature flow for processes such as orders, contracts, and daily reports.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
