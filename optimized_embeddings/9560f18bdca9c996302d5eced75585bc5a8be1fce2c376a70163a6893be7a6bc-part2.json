This behavior doesn’t mean they’re no longer interested; it’s just time to remind them about your great products and service.\n\nWe recommend sending a virtual hello through email. An inactive person probably doesn’t want to be put on the spot with a phone call. Snail mail is more likely to find its way to the recycle bin than the customer’s thoughts. Email is the happy medium of outreach to someone who just needs a nudge. After all, most people check their inbox daily.\n\nA few best practices can speed this email on its way.\n\nCreate an email template to ensure that your message is clear and well thought out. Add a merge field to capture the lead or customer’s first and last name. If you have different audiences, you can make a few email templates. It’s always easier than writing a message to each person from scratch.\nAdd the Email Opt Out field to your record page layout. Select it when a lead or contact says they no longer wish to receive communication from you. If you send an individual or mass email to a person with this field selected, the email is not delivered to the addressee.\nAdd the Last Activity field to your lead and contact records to show the date and time that you last communicated with your customer.\nSend the email one of three ways\nPROBLEM\tSOLUTION\tHOW IT'S DONE\nDon’t have many customers who go inactive? Want to keep a close eye on communications?\tOne by one\tOpen the lead or contact, and send the email template from there.\nTorn between having a large, inactive group or customers but still want oversight into who receives an email?\tManually, in bulk\tPull inactive leads or contacts together in a list view. Filter this list view by the Last Activity field. Select all records in the list view, and send a list email with the template.\nA little extra effort on the front end saves you time on the back end.\tAutomatically in bulk\tUse Process Builder to send emails weekly, monthly, or quarterly to inactive leads. You create your own process, but you can check out our sample recipe for ideas.\nCreate a Process to Re-engage Inactive Leads\nYou can use Process Builder to email inactive leads when it’s been 30 days since their last communication.\nSEE ALSO\nIndividually Opting Out of Email\nTurn On Activity Metrics\nWork with List Views in Lightning Experience\nEmail Templates\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
