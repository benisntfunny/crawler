A new expression set version is always blank. Each element forms a step in an expression set. Use the elements in the Expression Set Builder to form logical steps in the expression set. Steps in an expression set run sequentially. Depending on the type of the step element, a step can perform calculations, lookups, or condition evaluations that determine how the next step in the expression set is processed.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions for Industries clouds that have Business Rules Engine enabled\n\nTo start building your expression set version, open the version in the Expression Set Builder canvas, click , and then select an element.\n\nCalculation\nA calculation step element performs functions and mathematical operations on expression set resources—constants, variables, field aliases, and list variables.\nConditional Group and Condition\nA conditional group step element runs a group of steps if the expression in the condition element in the group evaluates to true. A conditional group can have these step elements: condition, calculation, lookup table, and subexpression. A condition step element is always the first element in the group. A condition step runs the step that follows if the condition expression evaluates to true. A condition step can only be used as part of a conditional group element, and not as a standalone step element.\nBranch\nA branch step element can have multiple conditional paths that an expression set version can take based on the priority that you assign to each path. A branch can have up to six paths, including the default path. Paths have priorities in a descending order from left to right. The left-most path has the highest priority. In a non-default path, the first step is the entry condition for the path. This condition determines whether to enter the path. If the branch step doesn't meet the entry conditions for the paths, it takes the default path—the path with no entry condition.\nLookup Table\nA lookup table step element matches your input values with the input rows in a decision matrix or a decision table. The table then returns the matching row’s output to the expression set version that the table is used in.\nSubexpression\nWhen you add a subexpression step element to an expression set version, you can select another expression set that you want to use within the version. The subexpression then returns the result of the expression set to the version that the subexpression is used in. You can use resources from a subexpression, including any input and output variables from lookup tables in the subexpression in other steps in the expression set version. You can use only expression sets with at least one active version as subexpressions in an expression set version.\nList Group and List Filter\nA list group step element filters items in a list based on the filter conditions, and then performs further operations on the filtered list. A list group can have these elements: list filter, calculation, lookup table, and business element. A list filter is always the first step in a list group, and defines how items in list variables are filtered. A list group can have only one list filter, but multiple calculation, lookup table, or business elements.\nAggregate and Aggregate Group\nAn Aggregate step performs a SUM, AVG, MAX, or MIN function on multiple runs of the preceding steps in an expression set version. Aggregate Groups run the previous steps in the version one time for each set of input values, and then aggregate the results of the steps based on the aggregation logic. Aggregate Groups can have these step elements: Aggregate and Calculation. You can also use Business Elements in an Aggregate Group, if the elements are shipped with your Industries cloud and available in your Salesforce org. Aggregate is always the first step element in an Aggregate Group. Aggregate steps can only be part of Aggregate Groups and can’t be used as standalone elements in an expression set version.\nBusiness Element\nBusiness elements perform the action that’s defined in the element. Each business element can have a specific purpose based on your cloud’s use cases. If a business element is available in your Salesforce org and is specific to the usage type of your expression set, then you can use it as a step in your expression set version.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
