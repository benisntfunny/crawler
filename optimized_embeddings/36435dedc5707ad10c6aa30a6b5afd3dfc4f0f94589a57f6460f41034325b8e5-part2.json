For example, you can create and test a new object in a sandbox org, then send it to your production org using a change set. Change sets can contain only modifications you can make through the Setup menu. For example, you can’t use a change set to upload a list of contact records. Change sets contain information about the org. They don’t contain data, such as records.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in Enterprise, Performance, Professional, Unlimited, and Database.com Editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo edit deployment connections:\t\n\nDeploy Change Sets\n\nAND\n\nModify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions\n\n\nTo use outbound change sets:\tCreate and Upload Change Sets\nTo use inbound change sets:\tDeploy Change Sets AND Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions\n\nWhen you want to send customizations from your current org to another org, create an outbound change set. After you send the change set, the receiving org sees it as an inbound change set.\n\nSending a change set between two orgs requires a deployment connection. Change sets can only be sent between orgs that are affiliated with a production org. For example, a production org and a sandbox, or two sandboxes created from the same org can send or receive change sets.\n\nPermission Sets and Profile Settings in Change Sets\nDevelopers can use permission sets or profile settings to specify permissions and other access settings in a change set. When deciding whether to use permission sets, profile settings, or a combination of both, consider the similarities and differences.\nComponents Available in Change Sets\nThe components available for a change set vary by experience and edition. Also, some components require corresponding features to be enabled in your Salesforce org.\nRestrictions for Approval Processes in Change Sets\nUnderstand these restrictions before you include approval processes in change sets.\nChange Sets Implementation Tips\nReview these tips before you implement your change sets.\nChange Sets Best Practices\nReview these best practices about dependencies, validation, and access settings.\nInbound Change Sets\nAn inbound change set is a change set that has been sent from another Salesforce org to the org you are logged in to. A change set must be deployed for the changes to take effect. You can deploy the contents of an inbound change set as a whole but not on a component-by-component basis.\nOutbound Change Sets\nAn outbound change set is a change set created in the Salesforce org in which you are logged in and that you want to send to another org. You typically use an outbound change set for customizations created and tested in a sandbox and that are then sent to a production org.\nSEE ALSO\nDeployment Connections for Change Sets\nSpecial Behavior in Deployments\nRelease Management Video: From Sandbox to Production How To Series (Salesforce Classic)\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
