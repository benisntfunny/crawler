Use Visit Management capabilities to help territory and district managers in your company perform visits at dealer locations.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nWith periodic visits, sales managers can monitor dealer performance, organize periodic check-ins, conduct trainings, upsell and cross-sell products, and follow up on brand promotion campaigns and customer feedback. You can use action plan templates to create lists of common tasks and metrics across multiple visits.\n\nWatch this video to understand the capabilities of Partner Visit Management in Automotive Cloud.\n\nIf you aren’t able to watch the view in full screen, open the video on a new tab: Foundations of Partner Visit Management in Automotive Cloud.\n\nWatch this video to see how sales managers and field officers set up and complete visits.\n\nIf you aren’t able to watch the view in full screen, open the video on a new tab: Manage Partner Visits in Automotive Cloud.\n\nThe district managers and evaluation officers on the ground can use their mobile devices to complete tasks and to capture critical dealer-performance metrics that help grow your business. The Partner Visits mobile app provides a comprehensive view of the list of visits for each day, the list of tasks and metrics for each visit, and an embedded map to help officers to easily navigate to dealer locations. After a visit is complete, you can compare the expected and the actual values for the defined key performance indicators and then take necessary actions.\n\nHigh-Level Workflow for Visit Management in Automotive Cloud\nReview the high-level procedure to set up and manage visits in Automotive Cloud.\nCreate Tasks for Dealer Visits\nCreate tasks for district managers and evaluation officers to perform during dealer visits. For example, the officer can check on the ongoing promotions at the dealer showrooms, discuss monthly targets or incentives with the dealer representatives, and upsell spare parts or accessories. The information and metrics collected by evaluation officers during these tasks provide helpful insights into dealer performance. Sales managers can define their own tasks and associate their own assessment indicators with the tasks to capture key business and performance metrics.\nAssess Dealer Visits with Metrics\nSales managers can relate Assessment Indicator Definition records to visit tasks to measure a dealer’s performance or compliance. Each task performed during a visit can be assessed based on different parameters or metrics. For example, a sales manager can create a numeric assessment indicator, Number of Vehicle Repairs, to count the number of vehicle repair jobs completed by a service dealer in the previous month. Or, the manager can create a date-time indicator, to capture the last date that the dealer participated in a product knowledge training.\nAdd Context for Tasks Performed During Dealer Visits\nMake dealer visits more meaningful by relating other Salesforce records with the tasks that evaluation officers perform during a visit. Sales managers can use Generic Visit Task Context records to relate a task with a specific context, such as the dealer’s Account record, a Sales Agreement record, or even an Asset Warranty record. For example, you can create a task for checking the promotion banners at a dealer showroom and relate the relevant Promotion record as the task context.\nCreate Dealer Visit Key Performance Indicators\nCreate Generic Visit Key Performance Indicator records to relate an assessment indicator definition to a visit task context. For example, a visit task, Quarterly Product Recalls, can be related to an assessment indicator definition, Number of Damaged Spare Parts. The sales manager can estimate an expected value based on the average number of damaged spare parts reported by dealers over the past few years per visit. During the visit, the district manager or evaluation officer can check with the dealer and capture the actual value based on how many damaged spare parts exist in a showroom. The sales manager can then find the information for both expected and actual values on the Generic Visit Key Performance Indicator record.\nCreate an Action Plan Template for Dealer Visits\nSales managers can create action plan templates to capture frequently performed tasks and to specify mandatory tasks. When you add tasks, the assessment indicator definitions related to a task are automatically added to the template. The template acts as a reusable framework because you can relate a template with multiple Visit records. For example, create an action plan template for quarterly front-office check-ins and add typical tasks, such as conducting a survey, upselling new vehicle accessories, and assessing ongoing promotions.\nCreate a Dealer Visit\nCreate a visit and assign an evaluation officer or district manager to the intended visit location, such as a dealer showroom, an office, or a warehouse. Provide an expected date and time for the visit and additional instructions if necessary.\nDetermine the Tasks to Perform During a Dealer Visit\nRelate an action plan to a visit to connect an action plan template with the visit. An action plan template contains the tasks and the task's related assessment indicators. When an action plan template is related to a Visit record, the tasks and the related indicators within the template are automatically related to the visit.\nVisit Dealers and Perform Tasks On the Go\nAs an evaluation officer or district sales manager, you’re always on the go and your mobile is the only device you carry. You’re expected to complete multiple visits each day, each with its own set of audit tasks and assessment criteria. Launch the Partner Visits app on your mobile device to check the list of visits for the day. When at a location, you can check the dealer’s details and start the assigned tasks for the visit.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
