Before you install the packages, review the considerations and prerequisites.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions\nIMPORTANT To ensure that you addressed any compliance considerations, consult with your legal counsel. These packages are considered Non-SFDC Applications under your organization’s Main Services Agreement, and that Main Services Agreement doesn’t apply to your use of these packages.\nGeneral Considerations\n\nThese considerations apply to Safety Cloud packages in general.\n\nSafety Cloud packages intend to provide tools that help accelerate the deployment of your COVID-19 Health Verification solutions.\n\nMake configuration decisions based on your particular use case.\n\nTo ensure the security of recipients’ information, we recommend using Multi-Factor Authentication and enabling Platform Encryption.\nMake sure that you follow secure coding guidelines. For more information, see the Salesforce Security Guide.\nTo manage public access to your vaccine form, follow Experience Cloud security practices. See Secure Your Experience Cloud Sites and Guest User Record Access Developer Best Practices.\nBe mindful of the values that you store about your recipients. We recommend that you avoid collecting information that you don’t need and any sensitive information that could be used for discrimination or other unlawful purposes. For more information, see our Acceptable Use and External-Facing Services Policy.\nAdhere to the accepted data-retention policies and related privacy laws for your organization, wherever they apply.\nConsiderations for the Safety Cloud Package\n\nThese considerations apply to the Safety Cloud package specifically.\n\nPerson accounts are mandatory for installing Safety Cloud and must be enabled in the org.\nWhen you install the Safety Cloud package, we enable Feed Tracking on the Health Verification object. For information on how to select and track specific fields on an object, see Feed Tracking.\nTo use Safety Cloud, you must accept the installer terms for the Safety Cloud Template package.\nSafety Cloud generates QR codes when criteria on the QR Code Generation records match data on an individual’s Health Verification record. For information, see QR Code Generation.\n\nSample QR Code for a Health Verification Record (JSON Format)\n\n\n{\"v\": \"a021100000JdI7NAAV\",”occ”: “a1U1B00000C9WcXUAV”, \n\"vs\": \"2021-12-16T08:00:00Z\",\"ve\": \"2021-12-17T07:59:59Z\"}\n\nWhere:\n\nThe value for \"v\" is the Verification ID.\nThe value for occ is the Occasion ID.\nThe value for \"vs\" is the Verification Start Date and Time.\nThe value for \"ve\" is the Verification End Date and Time.\n\nAny system that reads a QR code must read these four pieces of information. Dates are for offline support. If your event has unstable WiFi, the QR codes can be scanned using the start and end dates or times.\n\nYou can configure these fields so that the QR code is only valid for a specific set of hours, as shown in the sample.\n\nAccess Start Time = Beginning of day for negative test (the day of the event).\n\nAccess End Time = End of day for day of negative test (the day of the event).\n\nTo incorporate the Wellness Questionnaire into your health verification strategy, you must install the Surveys Feedback Management Starter package and enable Surveys in your org.\nThe user installing Safety Cloud must have the Salesforce Surveys Advanced Features Permissions.\n\nThe Advanced Features Permission enables your organization to use the predefined data mappings in the Wellness Questionnaire with Health Verification records.\n\nPrerequisites for the Safety Cloud Package\n\nIf you plan to use Marketing Cloud Engagement to send updates to recipients, set it up first. For details, see Marketing Cloud Engagement Setup.\n\nMake sure that you have the correct licenses. For the Safety Cloud package, you need Service Cloud licenses.\n\nIn Setup, turn on Data Protection and Privacy, and select Make data protection details available in records.\n\nWhat the Safety Cloud Package Changes in Your Org\n\nIf you have the person accounts enabled when a user submits a health verification, you can schedule a job to create a person account for that user. And for every subsequent health verification action, we assign the associated Health Verification record to the user’s person account.\n\nFor more information, see Person Accounts.\n\nWhen you download the Safety Cloud package, several things happen.\n\nWe turn on the Site.com Akamai Page Cache permission.\nWe add a Visualforce page for the flow safetycloud.SafetyCloudVerificationForm.\nWe create these permission sets that allow agents to view, approve, and reject health verification requests from your customers.\nSafetyCloud Admin\nSafetyCloud Agent\nSafetyCloud Health Verification Form Site User\nWe create a permission set called Health Verification Permission Set that lets agents view, approve, and reject health verification requests from your customers.\nWe create a Health Verification and Needs Review queue.\nWe create a platform cache org partition named HealthVerification in the safetycloud namespace.\n\nBy default, we allocate 3 MB to the cache org partition. However, through computation, an admin can determine how much space the platform cache org partition requires and allocate the space manually. For information, see Allocate Space to the Platform Cache Org Partition.\n\nProduct Limits\n\nSalesforce sets a character limit of 100 to the ExternalId custom field.\n\nSalesforce sets a transaction limit of 216,000 per hour.\n\nIf you anticipate exceeding this limit, contact Salesforce.\n\nTo contact Salesforce, log a case, and provide this information:\n\nThe production or sandbox Organization ID. To find the ID, from Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Company Information, and then click Company Information.\nYour requested limit.\nA business reason for the limit increase.\nLanguage Support for Safety Cloud Packages\n\nSupported languages for Safety Cloud packages are English, French (France and Canada), German, Español, and Spanish (Mexico).\n\nTo provide the Safety Cloud solutions in another language, use Translation Workbench. We don’t support right-to-left languages.\n\nConsiderations for the Safety Cloud Template Package\n\nSafety Cloud Templates rely on the Safety Cloud package for many key functions. Because the Safety Cloud Template package is Unlocked, you can change metadata, code, and configuration within the package. If you do change the Safety Cloud Template package, test your changes thoroughly in a sandbox with Safety Cloud before promoting them to production.\n\nChanging the metadata or code in the Safety Cloud Template results in a private version of the Safety Cloud Template and risks not being included in future enhancements of Safety Cloud. Instead of changing Safety Cloud Template code or metadata directly, we recommend that you make a copy of the code and metadata and selectively override the Safety Cloud Template package with your implementations. When Salesforce Engineering releases a new version of the Safety Cloud Template, you must test and reimplement your overrides as part of a manual upgrade operation. If you modify the Safety Cloud Template package in any way, Salesforce can’t guarantee that we won’t introduce breaking changes into the package.\n\nFor information about unlocked packages, see Build Your First Unlocked Package\n\nSEE ALSO\nThe Wellness Questionnaire and Health Verification\nQR Code Generation\nConfigure Safety Cloud to Generate QR Codes Automatically\nEnable Person Accounts\nSalesforce Surveys and Feedback Management\nCompare Licenses and Supported Survey Capabilities\nPerson Accounts\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
