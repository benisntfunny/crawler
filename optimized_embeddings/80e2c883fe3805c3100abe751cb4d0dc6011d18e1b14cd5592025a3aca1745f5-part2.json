See Create a Prompt Template.\n\nAdd merge fields, which reference resources, such as record fields, flows, related lists, and Apex (2). See Ground Prompt Templates with Salesforce Resources.\n\nTo preview a sales email response, select a Recipient (3). To generate the resolved prompt and the response, click Preview to generate the resolved prompt and the response. A field generation prompt template has a Record field instead of a Recipient field. See Preview a Generated Response.\n\nReview how the resources are resolved for the selected recipient (4). See Enable Resolution to Review a Prompt Template.\n\nReview the email generated by the LLM response (5). See Evaluate the Quality of a Response.\n\nSave and activate the prompt template (6). See Activate and Deactivate Prompt Templates.\n\nSelect the model to use, or view the model in Einstein Studio if you have the Data Cloud Admin permission set (7). See Changing LLM Configurations.\n\nWhen sensitive data is present in the template, it’s replaced with placeholder text in the prompt resolution. The Einstein Trust Layer masks sensitive data before the prompt can be sent to the LLM. The demasked data in the response is indicated by italics. Click View Your Data Masking Details in the banner (8) to see which placeholder text corresponds to each piece of masked data.\n\nBefore you save and activate a prompt template to make it available to your sales team, review and refine the prompt template. See Review, Revise, and Repeat: Ensure That a Prompt Template Is Effective.\n\nUnderstand Prompts and Prompt Templates\n\nBehind the scenes, large language models (LLMs) power Einstein generative AI. LLMs can help your users with all sorts of language-based tasks. For example, they can generate a personalized email to a customer, or analyze customer feedback and extract key insights. But LLMs can’t create great content by themselves. They need guidance from you in the form of a prompt.\n\nA prompt is the set of detailed instructions that you give an LLM. Similar to a recipe, a great prompt provides specific contextual information, data, instructions, and constraints that help the model generate accurate and personalized output. The output that the LLM generates is called a response.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nHere’s an example prompt that instructs the LLM to create a summary of open cases for the Astro’s Bakery account.\n\nYou’re a support representative and you need to create a short summary of all open cases for the Astro’s Bakery account.\n\nWhen I ask you to summarize the open cases, you must strictly follow my instructions below.\n\nInstructions:\n\"\"\"\nSummarize the open cases in one paragraph no longer than 500 characters. Mention how many open cases there are and what the case issues are.\nUse clear, concise, and straightforward language using the active voice and strictly avoiding the use of filler words and phrases and redundant language. \n\nUse the following information to write the summary: \n\nCase #1 details: The widgets we received are the wrong size. We needed a widget in size A, but we received a widget in size B.\n\nCase #2 details: Our Widgets haven’t been delivered. We can't track our order. According to the last tracking update, the Widgets should have arrived on June 5th. Now it's June 10th, and they still haven't arrived.\n\nDo not attribute any positive or negative traits in the summary.\n\"\"\"\n\nNow create the summary.\n\nHere’s a case summary that an LLM generated from the example prompt.\n\nThere are two open cases for the Astro’s Bakery account. In Case #1, the issue is that the received widget is the wrong size. The requested size was A, but size B was received instead. In Case #2, the issue is that the widgets haven’t been delivered and the order cannot be tracked. The expected delivery date was June 5th, but as of June 10th, the widgets have not arrived.\n\nThe quality of an LLM’s response depends on the prompt’s specificity. Vague or inaccurate instructions can lead an LLM to produce an irrelevant or a biased response. Sometimes an LLM can even hallucinate and generate false information. And because you make a new call to the LLM every time you run a prompt, its responses can differ, even if you’re passing in the exact same prompt. To prevent hallucinations and to minimize variability between responses, create a prompt with as much specific data as possible. Then it’s vital to review and edit your prompt until you consistently achieve high-quality, accurate responses.\n\nThis process of creating and iterating on a new prompt to generate just one high-quality response can be time-consuming. It’s even harder to design dozens of original prompts, each with different data and specifications. Also, prompts created by different people can produce inconsistent output due to variations in writing style. To scale prompt design efficiently, it’s best to use a prompt template, which is a reusable prompt. A prompt template includes placeholders for specific details about customers, products, and more.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nHere’s a prompt template that instructs an LLM to generate a summary of an account’s open cases. Unlike the previous example prompt, this prompt template doesn’t specify an actual account name or describe current open cases. Instead, the prompt template contains merge fields, such as {!$Input:Account.Id}, as placeholders.\n\nYou are a support representative and you need to create a short summary of all open cases for account {!$Input:Account.Id}.\n\nWhen I ask you to summarize the open cases, you must strictly follow my instructions.\n\nInstructions:\n\"\"\"\nSummarize the open cases in one paragraph no longer than 500 characters. Mention how many open cases there are and what the case issues are.\nUse clear, concise, and straightforward language using the active voice and strictly avoiding the use of filler words and phrases and redundant language. \n\nUse the following information to write the summary: \n\n{!$Flow:Get_Open_Cases_for_Account}\n\nDo not attribute any positive or negative traits in the summary.\n\"\"\"\n\nNow create the summary.\n\nNOTE The {!$Resource} wrapper syntax displays as Resource in the Prompt Builder UI. The wrapper syntax enables you to copy and paste the text into the Prompt Template Workspace with correctly configured resources.\n\nPrompt Builder replaces these placeholders in your template with your real data. The result is a prompt that’s tailored to the data that you selected. This process of populating a prompt template with specific data is called prompt resolution. An example of a resolved prompt is the prompt about the two open cases for the Astro’s Bakery account. With Einstein, prompt resolution is as easy as selecting Salesforce records to associate with the prompt.\n\nUsing prompt templates is ideal for B2C communications because they can generate consistent and data-driven output at scale. Templates that contain the same brand guidelines generate content with a unified voice and style. Each template is developed for a specific use case, and it can be reused by tailoring the prompt with different data.\n\nUse Prompt Templates in Salesforce Apps\n\nWhile you manage prompt templates in Prompt Builder, your users can benefit from prompts across Salesforce apps. When you integrate prompt templates with Sales Emails and Lightning record pages, Einstein can elevate users’ workflows. Instead of creating prompts from scratch, users can simply select records that fill the placeholders in the prompt template. The LLM generates a response that users can review and edit without leaving their current work environment. To fully benefit from generative AI, it isn’t necessary for your users to become prompt designers.
