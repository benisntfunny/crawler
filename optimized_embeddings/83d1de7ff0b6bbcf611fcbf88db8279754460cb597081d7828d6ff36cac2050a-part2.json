The reference architecture helps communicate the vision and strategy of a solution to business executives and stakeholders. Learn with Trailhead.\n\nOur reference architecture presents Functional and Platform capabilities. Each layer contains a representative subset of systems or capabilities that are most relevant for consumer goods organizations. It doesn’t list all possible systems or capabilities.\n\nPlatform Capabilities\n\nThese components form the underlying technology base for achieving your goals. Each layer in the platform builds on top of the next. B2B systems typically rely on these elements.\n\nCAPABILITY\tDESCRIPTION\nData Sources\tData sources are systems that create, collect, and manage various types of data. These systems can act as systems of record. They’re often purpose-built to handle particular functionality and data requirements, but some provide general system needs.\nIntegrations\tIntegrations include tools and routes that connect systems of record with each other or with higher-level experiences. Integrations can include varied tools like APIs that connect separate systems, single sign-on services to manage customer identity across different systems, and customer data platforms that segment customers.\nIntelligence\tSmart automation like machine learning and AI helps you optimize your use of customer data. To enhance your customer relationships and drive sales, the intelligence layer serves functions like delivering actionable customer insights, personalized product recommendations, and improving real-time customer interactions.\nAnalytics\t\n\nAnalytics helps you better understand your data and make smart business decisions.\n\nDescriptive analytics summarize existing data to help you better understand the current state or past activities. Descriptive analytics typically answer “What?” questions about your data.\nDiagnostic analytics use the output of descriptive analytics to identify patterns and outlier data. Diagnostic analytics typically answer “Why?” questions about your data.\nPredictive analytics use historical data to anticipate future outcomes, such as the likelihood that a subscriber opens an email.\nPrescriptive analytics suggest courses of action based on your existing data. Prescriptive analytics typically answer “Should?” questions about your future actions.\n\nPlatform Enablers\tUse common capabilities that drive the business processes across the enterprise. Build a unified profile using a customer data platform. Drive workflows and engagement based on that unified profile.\nFunctional Capabilities\n\nBusiness-specific elements at the functional capabilities level are connected more directly to the customer’s experience and measured in terms of maturity. Successful implementation of functional capabilities depends heavily on implementation of the platform capabilities.\n\nThe consumer goods industry is evolving to handle disruption and change. The traditional integrated route to markets focused the B2B business model on key account management and field retail execution via sales channels. The industry is now starting to engage end-consumers directly via B2C Commerce and self-service models in partner systems. The recent evolution of privacy is also driving marketing changes to understand consumer behavior more directly by gathering more first-party data.\n\nTo identify strategic goals around which to focus your implementation, review common B2C Business Scenarios for Retail and their included functional capabilities.\n\nA Business Capability Maturity Assessment arranged by your Success Manager or Account Executive can help you determine which areas of your business can benefit from more focus.\n\nMapping Platform Capabilities to Salesforce\n\nSpecific Salesforce products handle each of the needs identified at the platform capability level.\n\nIdentify gaps in your underlying capabilities by customizing this model to include other Salesforce products or third-party systems in your current technology stack.\n\nTo explore the reference architecture specific to your business, contact your Success Manager or Account Team.\n\nBusiness Scenarios for Consumer Goods help you better understand your business capabilities and find solutions that support your business goals.\n\nLearn more about Salesforce products in this industry.\n\nConsumer Goods Cloud\nCPQ\nMulesoft\nCommerce\nExperience Cloud\nService\nField Service\nSales\nAnalytics\nWork.com\nMarketing\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Architectural Diagrams: Quick Look\nIndustry Blueprint for Consumer Goods\nSolution Architecture for Consumer Goods\nBusiness Scenarios for Consumer Goods\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
