For example, you can create a segment of unified individuals based on who clicked links from your messages at least three times in the past month. Segment on the EventDateTime value associated with the Open event types, then collect the IndividualID values to determine who receives further messages.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
