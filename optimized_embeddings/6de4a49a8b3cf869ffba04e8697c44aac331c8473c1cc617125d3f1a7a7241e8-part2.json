We’ve got different features for all your business needs. Enable the ones that are relevant to your organization and set up those feature and their data for your users.\n\nAdvanced Therapy Management\nAdvanced Therapy Management’s Multi-Step Scheduling feature supports slot management and scheduling across multiple territories in a single place, to help users easily search for and book appointments across multiple sites. Advanced Therapy Orchestration provides flexible workflows that automatically execute all the components of an advanced therapy, from therapy stages and substages to individual tasks.\nBenefit Verification\nIntegrate benefit verification into the end-to-end patient access workflow to help caregivers and patients reduce the time and effort it takes to find out what coverage is available under each patient's health benefits.\nCare Program Management\nMaximize the impact of your care programs with enrollment and management tools to help drive adherence and improve outcomes. Care programs can cover services such as patient outreach, access to medications, access to care, financial assistance, or remote monitoring.\nCommercial Excellence\nMedical device manufacturers can manage their volume and price agreements at the product level with their customers using sales agreements. They can also manage account and product specific forecasts, and create account manager targets.\nIntelligent Sales\nMaximize productivity for your sales teams by giving them the tools required to efficiently plan and execute their surgical case visits and cycle counts. Give your teams valuable insight into field inventory and impacted revenue, with visits-based product availability projections. If someone has a product shortfall, they can request a product transfer from a nearby inventory. Reps can also blaze through cycle counts with fewer errors using their mobile devices.\nParticipant Management\nParticipant Management streamlines the process of recruiting and enrolling participants in clinical trials by orchestrating various stages, from initial recruitment to enrollment.\nPatient Program Outcome Management (Pilot)\nEnhance care program efficacy and get clear insights into program performance through Patient Program Outcome Management. Define program outcomes and indicators and connect program outcomes with patient progress, enabling measurement at the outcome-level. Enhance patient experience and adherence through customized assessments, compute response scores, and evaluate outcomes to refine patient service programs. Provide insights and boost the effectiveness of program leads in identifying the programs that diverge from anticipated outcomes and to implement preventive measures. Case managers can track patient adherence, and patient reported outcomes by monitoring patient progress via assessments, and proactively intervene if patients aren’t on track to achieve the desired outcomes.\nPharmacy Benefits Verification\nGain expedited access to patient care and efficiently verify benefit coverage details by using Pharmacy Benefits Verification. Pharmacy agents can use a streamlined process to assist patients in getting an accurate summary of their pharmacy benefits. Agents can use a guided flow to initiate a verification request to payers and receive a response for pharmacy coverage details, including coverage status, co-pay, co-insurance, deductibles, and total out-of-pocket expenses.\nProvider Relationship Cards\nSet up provider relationship cards to quickly and efficiently show users what they need to know about providers and the facilities where they work, all in one place. Identify the information your users look for on each Provider Relationship Card, then use the card setup wizard to connect the various objects that contain that information.\nProvider Search\nPowered by the provider data model, Provider Search helps your users find healthcare providers based on criteria such as location, specialty, and whether the provider is accepting new patients. You can even see the location of each provider right in Life Sciences Cloud.\nSocial Determinants of Health\nGive your users a holistic understanding of patients and members, so that they can provide more personalized care and support. Social workers and case managers capture critical social and environmental factors like homelessness and low income as barriers and related social determinants. With social determinants of health, they can create intervention tasks to address barriers and help mitigate avoidable adverse health events for patients and members.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
