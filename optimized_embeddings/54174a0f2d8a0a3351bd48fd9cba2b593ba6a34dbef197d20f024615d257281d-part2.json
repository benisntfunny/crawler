The number of console apps you can create is based on your Salesforce org’s custom app limits.\n\nFrom Setup, enter Apps in the Quick Find box, then select Apps, then click Next.\nClick New, select Console, and click Next. Optionally, to copy an existing console, click Clone on the console’s detail page. Save a console that you’ve copied before you can update its cloned push notifications or keyboard shortcuts.\nType a label for the app, then click Next. The label can have a maximum of 40 characters, including spaces. This label is the app’s name in the Lightning Platform app menu.\nOptionally, add a custom logo. Click Insert an image, choose a file image from the document library, then click Next.\nSelect the items to include in the navigation tab, then click Next. You can't add the following to the navigation tab: forecasts, ideas, answers, connections, portals, console, activities (tasks and events), the App Launcher, or buttons for customizing your org. Tab visibility settings, and the Overwrite users' personal tab customizations setting, don't apply to the navigation tab. For example, you can access Accounts from the navigation tab even if Accounts are Tab Hidden on user profiles.\nChoose how items that aren’t selected from a primary tab or subtab display, then click Next. For example, choose whether cases display as primary tabs or as subtabs on parent records when selected from list views, search results, or screen pops. Click:\nAs a primary tab to display the object's records as primary tabs.\nAs a subtab of to display the object's records as subtabs. From the drop-down list, choose the parent record where the subtabs appear. For example, if you want cases to appear as subtabs on contacts, select Contact Name (Contact) in the Cases row. If parent records don't apply, subtabs appear as primary tabs. For example, if you make campaigns a subtab of leads but a lead doesn't belong to a campaign, that campaign appears as a primary tab.\nOptionally, if your org has Service Cloud and Chat, select Include Chat in this App, and click Next. If you choose to include a chat workspace for Chat in your console, you can:\nChoose records or pages to open as subtabs of chat sessions.\nSelect Include Suggested Articles from Salesforce Knowledge in Chat to display the articles tool in the chat workspace.\nAssign the Salesforce console to user profiles:\nCheck the Visible box to choose the user profiles for which the app is available.\nCheck the Default box to set the app as that profile’s default app, meaning that new users with the profile see this app the first time they log in. Profiles with limits are excluded from this list.\nClick Save.\nTIP To see any setup changes to a console, refresh your browser.\nSEE ALSO\nSet Up a Service Console in Salesforce Classic\nSet Up Sales Console in Salesforce Classic\nBrand a Salesforce Console in Salesforce Classic\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
