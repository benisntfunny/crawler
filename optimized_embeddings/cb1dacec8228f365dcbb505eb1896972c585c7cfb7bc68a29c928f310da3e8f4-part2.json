Expression sets and various digital procedures can call decision matrices. Decision matrices accept JSON input from, and return JSON output to the digital processes that call the matrices. Decision matrices are useful for implementing complex rules in a systematic, readable manner.\n\nREQUIRED USER PERMISSIONS\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create, update, and delete decision matrices and matrix versions:\tRule Engine Designer\nTo use decision matrices in Business Rules Engine:\tRule Engine Runtime\n\nYou can choose from these decision matrix types based on your business needs:\n\nStandard Decision Matrices\nGrouped Decision Matrices\n\nMultiple versions of the same decision matrix can be active simultaneously. The start date, end date, and rank determine which version of the matrix to use. Ranks are ascending, so rank 2 is higher than rank 1. If the start date of one version of a decision matrix overlaps the end date of another, you can set rank values to determine which one to use. If a call to a decision matrix specifies an effective date, that date is used to find the correct matrix. If an effective date isn't specified, the default is today.\n\nStandard Decision Matrices\nStandard decision matrices have characteristics, such as input columns, output columns, and versions, that are common to all decision matrices, irrespective of their type. Use standard decision matrices when you don't need the matrix to be part of a group or to be versioned row by row.\nGrouped Decision Matrices\nWith grouped matrices, you can group a matrix's data into different versions if several rows have the same column values. For example, in a matrix with age and gender-based transport fares, you can use gender as the matrix key, with male and female as the key values for the versions. This grouping prevents repeating male and female as row values in the matrix and groups the data for males in one version and females in another.\nText Ranges in Decision Matrices\nIf your matrix has considerable data, use ranges to keep the matrix small. With text ranges, you can concisely specify a range of acceptable values in a matrix column instead of listing individual values.\nNumeric Ranges in Decision Matrices\nUse numeric ranges to keep matrices with sizable data small. With number ranges, you can concisely specify a range of acceptable values in a matrix column instead of listing individual values.\nGuidelines for Creating and Editing Decision Matrices\nDecision matrices require certain criteria to be met to successfully create versions or modify the data in existing versions.\nCreate Standard Decision Matrices\nYou can create a standard decision matrix by uploading a CSV file, by creating a version of an existing matrix, or manually.\nCreate Grouped Decision Matrices\nYou can create a decision matrix that groups rows in versions based on a group key and, if necessary, a sub group key. Versions in a grouped decision matrix can have different start date time values. When a grouped matrix is invoked, the group or subgroup keys are considered like input variables, for which you must provide values for lookup.\nManage and Maintain Decision Matrices\nLearn how to edit decision matrix rows and columns, sort and filter matrix rows, and export matrices to CSV or DMN files.\nDecision Matrix Migration Considerations\nHere are a few typical migrations scenarios and recommendations on how to maintain decision matrices in your target org for a successful migration.\nDecision Matrices for Developers\nDevelopers in your Salesforce org can employ decision matrix developer resources to use and extend decision matrices.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
