You can configure different services and programs that are available for public agencies and hospitals, such as emergency supply requests. For individuals, create programs such as food delivery services or short-term housing requests.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited editions.\nNOTE To test your implementation, make sure to log in as a user to create a service request. Requests are associated with person accounts, and the flow can’t run correctly for someone logged in as an admin.\nCreate Person Accounts for Self-Registering Site Users\nMake it easy for your users to self-register in your emergency services community. Instead of creating users as contacts under a single business account, you can assign each self-registering user to a person account.\nAdd Related Lists to Page Layouts\nAdd related lists to page layouts so your users have the information they need at their fingertips.\nAdd Custom Visit Priorities\nTrack the priority of your visits by creating custom priority picklist values.\nCustomize Picklist Values for Emergency Services\nAdd a custom picklist value and remove unnecessary picklist values for the Service Category field.\nCreate a Queue for Incoming Service Requests\nSet up the queue for incoming emergency service requests so that they can be reviewed and assigned to be fulfilled.\nConfigure Emergency Service Applications\nCreate service applications for businesses and individuals.\nSet Up an Approval Process for Service Request Applications\nConfigure an automated process to track and approve service request applications.\nSet Up Inspections\nWhen you set up inspections, your agency can create inspections for businesses and organizations, manage violations, and implement enforcement actions. Use assessment indicators that the inspector using the inspection app can access.\nSet Up Service Execution for Field Responders\nAfter setting up emergency response applications, configure action plans and Visits so your field responders can complete service requests.\nDeliver Emergency Supplies\nWhen someone requests a delivery of food or medicine, make sure that you can deliver it quickly and efficiently.\nCreate Training Courses\nCreate records for classes authorized by a government authority that qualify a license or permit.\nUse Salesforce Maps for Efficient Emergency Service Delivery\nGive emergency supplies delivery personnel precise location information so that they can get important emergency supplies to the people who request it. Salesforce Maps injects location intelligence into field operations to make emergency supply delivery services more efficient. The Create a Visit for Emergency Request Event flow ties the emergency request record to the event. When an emergency event is created, the Schedule an Emergency Visit process starts the flow. The flow creates the visit record, applies the action plan template, and creates the tasks.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
