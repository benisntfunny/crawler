Select the input fields from the business rules object or the custom metadata type for the decision table to read. Select one or more output fields that contain the values that are used to calculate outcomes.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with Loyalty Management or Rebate Management\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create, edit, and activate a decision table:\tSystem Administrator profile\nNOTE Decision tables are also available as part of Business Rules Engine. If your org has Business Rules Engine enabled, see Decision Tables for Business Rules Engine.\n\nTo determine when a decision table provides outcomes, always select one of these input field conditions.\n\nCONDITION\tHOW IT WORKS\tBUSINESS RULES (EXAMPLE)\tEVALUATED VALUES (EXAMPLE)\tOUTPUT (EXAMPLE)\nAll conditions are met (AND)\tThe decision table evaluates all the business rules against the values provided. If all the evaluated values match the corresponding input fields, the decision table provides the output field values of the matched business rules as the outcomes.\t\n\nThree business rules contain three input fields and one output field.\n\nRule 1:\n\nOrder Quantity (input 1): Less than 50\nProduct Name (input 2): Running Shoes\nProduct Category (input 3): Shoes\nDiscount (output): 5%\n\nRule 2:\n\nOrder Quantity (input 1): 50 or more\nProduct Name (input 2): Running Shoes\nProduct Category (input 3): Shoes\nDiscount (output): 10%\n\nRule 3:\n\nOrder Quantity (input 1): 40 or more\nProduct Name (input 2): Athletic Shorts\nProduct Category (input 3): Accessories\nDiscount (output): 7%\n\nThe business rules are sorted based on the Discount field and the sort order is Ascending with Blank Value Last.\n\n\t\n\nThe decision table provides outcomes for each of the three orders.\n\nOrder 1:\n\nOrder Quantity: 60\nProduct Name: Running Shoes\nProduct Category: Shoes\n\nOrder 2:\n\nOrder Quantity: 70\nProduct Name: Football Shoes\nProduct Category: Shoes\n\nOrder 3:\n\nOrder Quantity: 20\nProduct Name: Athletic Shorts\nProduct Category: Accessories\n\t\nOrder 1: 10%\nOrder 2: No output\nOrder 3: No output\n\nAny condition is met (OR)\tThe decision table evaluates all the business rules against the values provided. If any one of the evaluated values matches the corresponding input field, the decision table provides the output field values of the matched business rules as the outcomes.\t\nOrder 1: 5%, 10%, 7%\nOrder 2: 5%, 10%, 7%\nOrder 3: 5%, 7%\n\nCustom logic\tThe decision table evaluates all the business rules against the values provided. Based on the custom logic, if the values match, the decision table provides the output field values of the matched business rules as the outcomes.\t\n\nLogic: (1 AND 2) OR 3\n\nOrder 1: 10%\nOrder 2: No output\nOrder 3: 7%\n\nA decision table can contain up to 10 input columns and 5 output columns, and read up to 100,000 rules. If the object or the custom metadata type contains more than 100,000 rules, the decision table reads only the first 100,000 based on the creation date. To create a decision table:\n\nFrom Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Decision Tables, and then select Decision Tables.\nClick New.\nProvide these details.\nFIELD\tVALUE\nName\tEnter the name of the decision table. The API name is auto-populated based on the name you enter.\nSource Object\tSelect the object that contains the business rules for the decision table to read.\nClick Next.\nSelect the fields to be used as inputs, and select an operator for each.\nThe operator allows you to decide how a particular field from the business rule evaluates a record or a user-specified value. For example, for a picklist field that contains the brand names with product discounts, the operator is Equals. The operator allows the decision table to compare the brand names specified in the rules against the value in the record or the user-specified value being evaluated. The outcome is the output field of the rule that contains the brand name that equals the record field or the user input.\nNOTE If you select a Picklist (Multi-Select) type input field, the decision table reads up to 512 characters. So the first set of picklist values that total 512 characters are considered. This limit includes semicolons used as value separators. A decision table can also read the first 15 digits in a number field.\nTo group your business rules, select a frequently used input value, and then assign the Equals operator.\nSelect the output fields.\nA Picklist (Multi-Select) type field can't be selected as an output field.\nTo sort outcomes, select the sort order for the field based on whose values the outcomes must be sorted.\nOutputs can’t be sorted based on picklist and multi-select picklist fields.\nSelect Don't Use for fields that you don’t want the decision table to consider.\nClick Next.\nSelect the input fields condition.\nIf you select Custom Logic, specify the logic.\nTIP The Number column indicates the sequence number of the fields. If you have three input fields and want to use a custom logic to ensure that outputs are provided when field 1 and 2 match or when field 3 matches, specify (1 AND 2) OR 3.\nIf you want to group the business rules, select the input fields condition as All conditions are met (AND), and then select a value for Group By.\nYou can’t group business rules with OR or custom condition types.\nSave your changes.\nSupported Data Types and Operators\nDecision tables support specific field types as inputs and outputs. A field’s data type determines the operators that are available for it.\nUnderstand How Outcome Sorting Works\nWhen creating a decision table, you can specify a sort order for the outcomes based on the values of either an input or an output sort by field. Outcomes are finally sorted based on the value of the sort by field in the outcome’s record and the sort order.\nSEE ALSO\nDecision Table Key Terms and Workflow\nCreate a Decision Table to Determine Order Discount Percentage (Example)\nInvoke a Decision Table\nDecision Table Metadata API\nBusiness Rule Grouping\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
