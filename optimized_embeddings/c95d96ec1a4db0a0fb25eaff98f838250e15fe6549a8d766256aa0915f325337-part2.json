Taking advantage of this technology, we can provide faster, easier access to the Salesforce portfolio of innovative products and services.\n\nThe Salesforce Platform\n\n​The cloud-based Salesforce platform, which includes Service Cloud and Sales Cloud, is the foundation of Nonprofit Cloud and is included with the product. The platform provides relationship management, collaboration, integration, and data insight capabilities that give you a 360-degree view of constituents so that you can serve, manage, and interact with them more effectively. And it adheres to stringent data security regulations, so you can deploy and scale it quickly.​\n\nNonprofit Cloud Data Model\n\n​The Nonprofit Cloud data model includes Constituent Management, Fundraising, Program Management, Case Management, and Outcome Management. Constituent Management gives you the information you need to understand the 360-degree view of your constituents, manage their complex relationships, and visualize how they know each other. With Fundraising, engage donors, raise funds, and drive outcomes with tools for strategic planning and data-driven insights. Use Program Management to increase productivity, eliminate data silos, and make timely decisions by managing and delivering your programs. Case Management drives participant achievements by helping case managers see the full picture of every participant and deliver individualized participant experiences. Use Outcome Management to define your impact strategy or theory of change, collect your data, track your progress, and evaluate the effectiveness of your programs.​\n\nThe Toolkit\n\nAlso included in Nonprofit Cloud is a collection of components and tools that put the platform and data model to work. OmniStudio, Action Plans, Actionable Relationship Center (ARC), Business Rules Engine, and other components, services, and tools help you automate paper-based and cumbersome processes. For example, you can create dynamic questionnaires to speed up the intake and referral process.​\n\nExperience Cloud for Nonprofits and Nonprofit Cloud for Grantmaking\n\nGo beyond the Nonprofit Cloud data model with Experience Cloud for Nonprofits or Nonprofit Cloud for Grantmaking.​\n\nWith Experience Cloud for Nonprofits, provide a secure online portal to collaborate with external users. Site users can do things like view and work with cases, programs, and benefits. Restrict or grant users' access to objects and features as your business requires.​\n\nNonprofit Cloud for Grantmaking includes access to grant and budget management features. The Grantmaking data model helps you manage the entire grant life cycle. Create funding opportunities, manage applications and reviews, track grant applicant budgets and results, and more.​\n\nTalk to your account executive to learn more.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n​Data Protection and Privacy\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
