For a list of all searchable objects and fields, see Searchable Fields by Object in Lightning Experience.\n\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nSearches for Contract Line Item, Resource Absence, Return Order Line Item, Service Resource Skill, Service Territory Member, and Work Order Line Item\t\t\t\n\nThese objects can be viewed only as related lists on an object.\n\n\nSearches for Users\t\t\t\n\nIn Lightning Experience, search results for Users are listed under the header “People,” except in Setup.\n\n\nSearches for Attachments and Documents\t\t\t\n\nOnly Files are available in search results, not Attachments, or Documents.\n\nFor information about Files, Documents, and Attachments, see Files and Content: What’s Different or Not Available in Lightning Experience in Salesforce Help.\n\nSearch Layouts\n\nIn Lightning Experience, use the Search Results search layout to change the fields shown as columns in both global search and lookup search results. The Search Results search layout also determines which fields can be filtered on the search results page.\n\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nCustomizations to the Lookup Dialogs, Lookup Phone Dialogs, and Search Filter Fields layouts\t\t\t\n\nCustomizing Lookup Dialogs and Search Filter Fields is possible in Lightning Experience through Search Results Layouts. Lookup Phone Dialogs customization isn’t available in Lightning Experience.\n\n\nCustomizations to Event and Task search layouts\t\t\t\n\nActivities are shown as separate events and tasks on the search results page. The Search Layouts for Events and Tasks can't be customized.\n\n\nCustom buttons on search results pages\t\t\t\nFiltering and Sorting on the Search Results Page\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nFiltering on the search results page\t\t\t\n\nYou can filter search results for standard objects and custom objects.\n\nFiltering isn’t available for other objects. To get the best matches, make sure that your search terms are as specific as possible.\n\nWhen you filter by dates, you can select from predefined ranges such as “Last 7 Days” and “Last 30 Days.” You can’t enter a custom date range.\n\n\nSorting search results for Groups\t\t\t\n“Exact phrase” and “limit to items I own” filter options\t\t\t\nOther Differences for Search Results\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nSidebar Search and Advanced Search\t\t\t\n\nTo search, use the global search bar in the header in Lightning Experience, and refine results using filters on the search results page for each object.\n\n\nSearch All\t\t\t\n\nThere isn’t a Search All option in search results. The Top Results page shows the most relevant records for the objects you’re most likely to need. Results are grouped by object.\n\nTo see results for other objects, click object names on the left side of the page, under Search Results. If you don’t see an object listed under Search Results, select Show More to see all objects available to you, listed in alphabetical order.\n\n\nPinning objects on the search results page\t\t\t\n\nIn Lightning Experience, you can't pin objects, but search results appear that are sorted by relevance. Top Results appear on the left side of the results page. Top Results are prioritized for your most frequently used objects and include objects commonly associated with the search term.\n\nFor Salesforce Classic, you can pin objects. Pinning objects doesn’t affect the order of the objects under the Search Results on the left side of the page.\n\nLookup Search\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nUser-defined lookup filter fields\t\t\t\n\nBecause lookup search results use the same relevance rankings as global searches, users see the most relevant results first.\n\n\nAdmin-Defined Related and Dependent Lookup Filters\t\t\t\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, admins set lookup filters as required or optional. In Lightning Experience, all lookup filters are required, even if admins specify them as optional in Setup. In Lightning Experience, users don’t see an option to Show all results.\n\n\nNew Button in Lookup Search Window\t\t\t\n\nNot all objects are supported.\n\nIn Lightning Experience, you can create these objects from lookup search windows: accounts, cases, contacts, custom objects, events, leads, notes, opportunities, price books, products, and tasks. For other objects, create the desired object or record before using the lookup dialog search to associate records.\n\nKnowledge Search\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nAttaching External Documents to Cases in the Knowledge One Widget\t\t\t\n\nDocuments from external data sources, including Federated Search, can’t be attached to cases from the Knowledge sidebar.\n\n\nMaking Spelling Correction for Knowledge Articles Optional\t\t\t\n\nSpelling correction for Knowledge Articles can’t be disabled for Lightning Experience.\n\nThe Enable English-Only Spell Correction for Knowledge Search option on the Salesforce Classic Search Settings page affects only Knowledge searches in Salesforce Classic.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
