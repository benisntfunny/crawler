Your admin will configure the available Assessment scores and Assessment types.\n\nTIP Since each organization works with Assessments in different ways, Assessment Score fields are flexible. You can continue using the scoring systems you already have in place (for example, a scale of 1-10 or even a monetary value, such as monthly income). As long as Assessment Scores use numeric values, Case Management can store and render them on the Assessment Chart.\nEnter Assessment Scores\n\nUse assessment scores and charts to track your clients' progress.\n\nTo record Assessment Scores for a client:\n\nNavigate to the client's Contact record.\n\nClick the Assessments related list, then click New.\n\nEnter the Assessment Name. We recommend using a standardized naming convention, such as: Client Name, Assessment type, Date.\n\nEnter the Assessment Completed Date.\n\nOptionally, add a Program Engagement.\n\nEnter the Assessment score. It must be a numeric value.\n\nOptionally, add comments.\n\nClick Save.\n\nClick Refresh to see your Assessment scores on the Assessment Chart. Note that clicking a score name in the legend toggles that score on and off. Also, hovering over the score displays the comment.\n\nIf your org has configured multiple Assessment types, choose the record type and click Next to enter Assessment scores.\n\nTo select from multiple Assessment types on the Assessment Chart, select the Assessment Record Type from the Record Type dropdown.\n\nYou can also control the display by filtering on Start and End Dates.\n\nAdd Threshold Markers to Assessment Charts\n\nAdd horizontal threshold lines to your Assessment Charts and quickly see your client's progress towards the goals you set. You decide the number of thresholds, their values, line colors, and labels.\n\nFor example, you have an assessment for measuring where a client is in terms of financial literacy. You could set threshold lines of Basic with a blue line at 20, Average with a yellow line at 40, and Advanced with a green line at 80.\n\nCreate thresholds in Custom Metadata Types:\n\nIn Setup, enter Custom Metadata Types in Quick Find, and then click Custom Metadata Types.\n\nNext to Assessment Thresholds, click Manage Records.\n\nClick New.\n\nEnter your threshold details. Label is what you use internally to identify the threshold and Title is the display name.\n\nSave your threshold.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
