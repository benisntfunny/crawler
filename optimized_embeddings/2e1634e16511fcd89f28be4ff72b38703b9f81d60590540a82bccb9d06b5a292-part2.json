Specifically, we support license upgrades for all users where their UserType equals CSPLitePortal (in the Salesforce API) to PowerPartner or PowerCustomerSuccess.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nApplies to: LWR, Aura, and Visualforce sites\nNOTE Community licenses are used to access Experience Cloud sites.\n\nYou can upgrade the following licenses to the Customer Community Plus or Partner Community licenses.\n\nCustomer Community\nExternal Identity (enables access to the Salesforce Customer Identity product)\nHigh Volume Customer Portal\nOverage High Volume Customer Portal\nAuthenticated Website User Overage\nAuthenticated Website User\n\nThere are other customer licenses associated with the CSPLitePortal user type that support license upgrades, but with some loss of data access. For example, the user can lose access to some objects they previously had access to, or the new license might not include one or more user permissions available with the previous license. For example, the Modify All Records and View All Records permissions aren’t available with Customer Community Plus or Partner Community licenses.\n\nWARNING\n\nWe strongly recommend that you explore what permissions are affected before you upgrade a user’s license. The user’s new license, profile, role, and permission set assignments should provide at least the same or comparable level of data access as previous assignments.\n\nConsiderations When Upgrading a User’s License\n\nSelf-registration with a Customer Community license is twice as fast as self-registration using a Customer Community Plus license. If your site requires a large number of users to register at a time, configure self-registration to use micro-batching for Customer Community Plus sites.\nThe Customer Community Plus and Partner Community licenses require the user to have a role, which imposes a few restrictions. We recommend that you use account role optimization for role-based licenses to help avoid performance and scale issues.\nAn upgrade to a license that requires a role is irreversible.\nIf the user belongs to an account that doesn’t have roles, we create one for you.\nIf the account does have roles and you don’t specify one, we associate the user with the lowest role in the hierarchy: Partner <Account Name> User or Customer <Account Name> User.\nUsers can own up to 50,000 person accounts. If more person accounts are needed, create a Person Account Owner Power User. A Person Account Owner Power User can own more than 50,000 accounts.\nBefore upgrading a user to the Partner Community license, enable the user’s account as a partner account. A partner account can be associated with both customer and partner users, so customer users on the same account aren’t affected.\nA license upgrade automatically removes sharing sets, permission sets, and permission set license assignments previously associated with the user.\nLicense upgrades are subject to most limits that apply to new users, such as the maximum number of licenses and roles in your org and username uniqueness requirements.\nConsider the scale of your org when upgrading your license. For example, a Customer Community license can support 100 million users, whereas a Customer Community Plus license can support 10 million.\nChanges in profiles and permission sets can affect site membership. Ensure that upgraded users have access to the intended Experience Cloud sites.\nWe recalculate sharing rules that apply to the upgraded user, for example through their public groups, criteria-based sharing, and record ownership (implicit sharing).\nUsers upgraded to the Customer Community Plus are automatically associated with the All Customer Portal Users public group. Similarly, users upgraded to the Partner Community licenses are associated with the All Partner Users public group.\n\nLicense Conversion and Upgrade Compatibility\n\nORIGINAL LICENSE\tCONVERT TO...\nCUSTOMER COMMUNITY (NAMED USER OR LOGIN BASED)\tCUSTOMER COMMUNITY PLUS (NAMED USER OR LOGIN BASED)\tPARTNER COMMUNITY (NAMED USER OR LOGIN BASED)\n\n\nPartner\n\nGold Partner\n\nSilver Partner\n\nBronze Partner\n\n\t\n\nSwitching from a partner portal license to a Customer Community license results in a loss in functionality.\n\nAn admin must disable the contact as a Partner User and re-enable as a Customer User.\n\n\t\n\nSwitching from a partner portal license to a Customer Community Plus license results in a loss of functionality.\n\nAn admin must disable the contact as a Partner User and re-enable as a Customer User.\n\n\t\n\nAn admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Portal Manager Custom\n\nCustomer Portal Manager Standard\n\nOverage Customer Portal Manager Custom\n\nOverage Customer Portal Manager Standard\n\n\t\n\nSwitching from a customer portal license to a Customer Community license results in a loss in functionality.\n\nAn admin must disable the contact as a Customer User, and then re-enable as a Customer User to create a user record and associate it with the new license.\n\n\t\n\nAn admin can convert a Customer Portal Manager Custom, Customer Portal Manager Standard, Overage Customer Portal Manager Custom, or Overage Customer Portal Manager Standard license (for a named user) to a Customer Community Plus license and vice versa, by changing the license type and profile on user record.\n\n\t\n\nAn admin must disable the contact as a Customer User, ensure the account is enabled as a Partner Account, and then enable the contact as a Partner User.\n\n\n\n\nExternal Identity\n\nHigh Volume Customer Portal\n\nOverage High Volume Customer Portal\n\nAuthenticated Website User Overage\n\nAuthenticated Website User\n\n\t An admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\t An admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\t An admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\nCustomer Community\t\n\nAn admin can convert a Customer Community license (for a named user) to a Customer Community Login license and vice versa, by changing the license type and profile on user record.\n\n\t An admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\t An admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\nCustomer Community Plus\t\n\nSwitching from a Customer Community Plus license to a Customer Community license results in a loss in functionality.\n\nAn admin must disable the contact as a Customer User, and then re-enable as a Customer User to create a user record and associate it with the new license.\n\n\t\n\nAn admin can convert a Customer Community Plus license (for a named user) to a Customer Community Plus Login license and vice versa, by changing the license type and profile on user record.\n\n\t An admin must disable the contact as a Customer User, ensure the account is enabled as a Partner Account, and then enable the contact as a Partner User.\nPartner Community\t\n\nSwitching from a Partner Community license to a Customer Community license results in a loss of functionality.\n\nAn admin must disable the contact as a Partner User and re-enable as a Customer User.\n\n\t\n\nSwitching from a Partner Community license to a Customer Community Plus license results in a loss of functionality.\n\nAn admin must disable the contact as a Partner User and re-enable as a Customer User.\n\n\t\n\nAn admin can convert a Partner Community license (for a named user) to a Partner Community Login license and vice versa, by changing the license type and profile on the user record.\n\n\nExternal Apps\t\n\nAn admin can convert a Customer Community license (for a named user) to a Customer Community Login license and vice versa, by changing the license type and profile on user record.\n\n\t An admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\t An admin can change the license type and profile on the user record.\n\nTo upgrade users with other license types, you must deactivate them, create user identities for them, migrate their data over, and associate it with their new user records.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
