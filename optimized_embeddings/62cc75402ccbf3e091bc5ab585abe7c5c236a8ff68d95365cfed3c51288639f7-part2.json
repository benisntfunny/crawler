With the B2C Commerce native integration, you can:\n\nImport inventory data into Omnichannel Inventory from external sources\nConnect Omnichannel Inventory to external sales channels and customize inventory experiences\nGet near real-time inventory availability data across all your digital channels\nSegment inventory for specific storefronts using location groups\nSet up inventory sharing from multiple locations, stores, and distribution centers\nEnable ship from store, curbside pickup, and buy online, pick up in store\n\nKeep these considerations in mind when integrating Omnichannel Inventory with B2C Commerce.\n\nOmnichannel Inventory doesn’t support perpetual availability for individual inventory records. However, you can implement similar functionality in these ways.\nUse a B2C Commerce inventory list’s Default In-Stock setting. When an order uses an inventory list with Default In-Stock turned on, products not on the list are available. However, those products aren’t included in reservation requests. If you use Default In-Stock this way, customize your order workflow to create and manage reservations for those products.\nIn Omnichannel Inventory, set a product’s available inventory at one or more locations to 999999999. In B2C Commerce, handle that product normally. In this case, customize your order workflow to fulfill orders for that product at an appropriate location.\nBefore refreshing a Salesforce sandbox org that’s integrated with a B2C Commerce instance, log a case with Salesforce Customer Support. Support reconnects the refreshed org to your B2C Commerce instance.\nIf you experience issues with the integration, or want to disconnect your B2C Commerce instance from Omnichannel Inventory, log a case with Salesforce Customer Support. Before doing so, consider these recommendations:\nIdentify which inventory reservations are made in each system and handle them appropriately.\nIf you plan to turn on the integration again, maintain the Omnichannel Inventory data import processes. By keeping them active, the data cache is up to date when you turn the integration back on.\n\nB2B Commerce\n\nIf you’re using B2B Commerce with Salesforce Order Management and Omnichannel Inventory, you can access all the Salesforce Commerce APIs and Connect REST APIs for Omnichannel Inventory.\n\nUse the APIs to:\n\nCreate integrations in your B2B storefront using Omnichannel Inventory functionality to power custom-built experiences for inventory\nExecute and manage inventory allocation flows using Connect REST APIs with Salesforce Order Management\n\nSalesforce Order Management\n\nWith the Order Management native integration with Omnichannel Inventory, you can:\n\nImport inventory data into Omnichannel Inventory from external sources\nConnect Omnichannel Inventory to external sales channels and customize inventory experiences\nGet inventory availability data for SKUs, locations, and location groups\nTransfer reservations from a location group to a location or from one location to another location\nRelease reservations from a location group and its locations during cancellations\nFulfill reservations from a location group and its locations\nUnlock distributed order management tools for enhanced order management functionality\n\nExternal Systems\n\nOmnichannel Inventory uses headless APIs to retrieve inventory updates from your back-office system and provide real-time availability on your storefront. When shoppers add items to their online shopping carts and submit their orders, Omnichannel Inventory reserves inventory items and updates the inventory counts in your back-office system.\n\nTo import inventory from an external source into Omnichannel Inventory, use the Omnichannel Inventory headless API for imports.\n\nSEE ALSO\nOmnichannel Inventory Headless API Endpoints\nOmnichannel Inventory Connect REST APIs\nOmnichannel Inventory APIs\nTroubleshooting the Omnichannel Inventory Integration\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
