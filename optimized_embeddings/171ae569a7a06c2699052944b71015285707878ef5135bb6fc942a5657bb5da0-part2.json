Record owners can also edit any post on records they own, no matter who created the post.\n\nA Chatter Settings option and user permissions control the availability of the feed post editing feature.\n\nNOTE In addition to permissions, sharing rules can affect user access to feed post editing, including who can delete a post.\n\nThe Allow users to edit posts and comments option in Chatter Settings enables or disables the Edit Feed Post feature for your organization. This option is enabled by default in existing and new organizations. All users who are assigned a standard profile can edit their own posts and comments immediately, except for Chatter Free, Chatter External, and Customer Portal users. For users who are assigned custom profiles, administrators must specifically enable the permissions in the users’ custom profiles or permission sets.\n\nThe “Edit My Own Posts” permission lets users edit their own posts. This permission is available and automatically enabled on standard profiles, except Chatter External, Chatter Free, and Customer Portal User profiles. To allow Chatter External, Chatter Free, or Custom Portal users to edit their own posts, clone the profiles. Enable the “Edit My Own Posts” permission in the cloned profiles. Then assign the cloned profiles to the users.\n\nThe “Edit Posts on Records I Own” permission lets users edit all posts and comments on the records they own—both their own and other users’. For example, a group owner or manager can edit all posts on the group’s feed. A manager for a particular record type can edit all posts on the record. This permission is available on standard and custom profiles, but it’s disabled by default.\n\nThe “Can Approve Feed Post and Comment” permission is a powerful option to consider when assigning editorial capability. Users with this permission can edit and delete the posts and comments of any person in the Chatter feeds that they have access to. Consider whether it’s useful to have a few users with this capability. But also consider that assigning this permission places whoever has it in a position of trust. Be thoughtful about whom you assign it to.\n\nThis table summarizes the permissions and their default settings.\n\nUSER PERMISSION\tDESCRIPTION\tAVAILABLE IN\tDEFAULT SETTING\nEdit My Own Posts\tAllows users to edit their own posts\t\n\nStandard profiles, except\n\nChatter External User\nChatter Free User\nHigh Volume Customer Portal User\nPartner Community User Profile\n\tEnabled in all new and existing organizations\nCustom profiles\tDisabled in all new and existing organizations\nEdit Posts on Records I Own\tAllows record owners to modify their own posts and posts other users made on groups and record detail pages.\tCustom profiles\tDisabled in all new and existing organizations. However, Chatter moderators, Experience Cloud site moderators, and users with “Modify All Data” permission can always edit all posts and comments.\n\nThe Allow users to edit posts and comments option in Chatter Settings is enabled by default. For users who have the required permissions, the Edit option is available from the menu on posts, comments, questions, and answers. It opens a separate Edit window, where users can modify the text.\n\nAfter users save their edited version of the post, it shows an Edited timestamp to indicate that the original post was modified.\n\nIf users edit a post or comment and mention new people or groups, those people and groups receive email notifications. But the people and groups who were mentioned in the original post or comment don’t receive a new email notification. Email notifications for edited posts or comments show the Edited timestamp.\n\nFor Experience Cloud site users, feed post editing is available only if the site was created using either Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce or the Customer Service template.\n\nThe Edit option isn’t available on system-generated posts like feed tracked record updates.\n\nEnable Edit Feed Post in User Profiles or Permission Sets\nBy default, feed post editing is disabled on all custom profiles. To make the feature available to your users, you can either modify your user profiles or assign the permissions to users via a permission set.\nDisable Edit Feed Post for All Users\nBy default, all users who are assigned a profile with the feed post editing permissions enabled can edit their posts and comments. If needed, you can disable feed post editing for all users in your organization, regardless of their assigned user profile. You can also shut off post and comment editing for all users assigned the “Can Approve Feed Post and Comment” permission.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
