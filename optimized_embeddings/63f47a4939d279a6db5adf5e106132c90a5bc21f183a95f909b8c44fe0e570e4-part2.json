Make the case for MFA by addressing the risks of the current threat landscape. And explain the benefits and ROI that your company and your customers get by adding another layer of protection for Salesforce logins. You need this group’s support to green light an MFA project and allocate resources for the work.\n\nTo make the case and get approval for rolling out MFA to your users:\n\nDescribe the risks and potential impacts to your business by not using MFA. Show data about the risks and consequences of common security threats, especially for your market or industry.\nExplain the benefits and ROI that your company can realize from the added security of MFA.\nDiscuss your recommendations for an MFA implementation.\nFrame the issues in terms that resonate with your audience and speak to their priorities.\nTIP\n\nSalesforce commissioned Forrester Consulting to conduct the Total Economic Impact™ of Multi-Factor Authentication from Salesforce study to help customers understand the benefits of adopting MFA. Use this study to educate your leadership and stakeholders on how MFA can add value to your business’ bottom line. Want a teaser? An organization can achieve up to 164% return on their MFA investment over 3 years, with a payback in less than 6 months!\n\nWhen covering the benefits of MFA, consider these points:\n\nData Protection\tMFA helps protect your highly valuable Salesforce data by making it more difficult for attackers to compromise user credentials.\nCustomer Security\tAs a steward for your customers’ data, employing strong security controls like MFA helps reduce the risk of downstream impact to their businesses. You can provide assurances to customers about your security posture.\nSecurity Best Practice\tWith MFA, you’re aligning to a common industry trend that is globally recognized as a best practice for minimizing security risk.\nCorporate Responsibility\tAs your business evolves, you have a responsibility to your customers, shareholders, and employees to protect your products, information, and business.\nBusiness Value\tTranslate IT benefits like “improved security” into business value by showing how MFA can improve customer confidence, protect your company’s reputation, avoid site or application downtime, and ward off costs and liability associated with a data breach.\n\nIt’s also valuable if you can demonstrate how MFA can help achieve other business priorities or goals. For example:\n\nLegal Requirements\tDo you have authentication, user security, or data loss requirements that govern your business, your commitments to customers who inherit your security, or your commitments to shareholders? MFA can be an effective way to meet them.\nCompliance Requirements\tYour organization probably operates under some kind of audit structures, many of which include authentication requirements. You probably also have security policies that you must follow, which could be met through MFA.\nFuture and Evolving Requirements\t\n\nConsider your business objectives in the next 12 months. Are you planning on expanding business to new customer segments or markets that require increased security? Is there a change planned that would benefit from MFA?\n\nAlso consider your security goals. Does an MFA implementation help you meet any current or emerging enterprise security mandates? MFA is likely a strong mitigation option for emerging risks, or a solution for planned security goals.\n\nTIP For help with making the case, check out the customizable MFA presentation deck that’s included in the downloadable MFA Rollout Pack.\nSEE ALSO\nDetermine Business and User Requirements for MFA\nPlan Your Multi-Factor Authentication Rollout\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
