However, segments used with marketing campaign flows must use the default data space and segment on the Unified Individual object.\n\nYou usually select activation targets and activate segments, but in Marketing Cloud Growth activations aren’t needed. After you create a segment and publish it, it’s ready to use with a campaign. Review your publishing schedule if you plan to use it with automated messages.\n\nNew to Data Cloud segments?\n\nIn its simplest form, a segment is a set of filtering rules that are used to identify matching records in your database. You start with the total available audience, and add filters to reduce that population down to your target audience. In Marketing Cloud Growth, the filters are often firmographic or engagement related, and the returned records are IDs for the contact points related to matching unified individuals.\n\nThe segment canvas is where you build the rules for your segment. The attribute library shows available objects and fields. Choose the Include or Exclude tab, drag fields into the center, and then define the rule. You can nest existing segments or restrict results by aggregation criteria, such as starting with a population with at least 5 orders.\n\nTo build complex segments, group attributes in containers. When multiple container paths are shown, verify the container path for the right results. See an example.\n\nOther Things to Know\nA segment can contain up to 50 filters on the Include tab and 50 filters on the Exclude tab.\nYou can choose a publishing schedule that meets your business needs. Before choosing these options, consider how the increased usage impacts your billing.\nSelect Don’t Refresh when you want to create a static segment that doesn’t change.\nTo update the segment population regularly, choose Standard Publish and refresh at 12 hours or 24 hours.\nRapid Publish uses only a week of recent data, and can refresh at one or four hours. This option can be helpful if you’re running a time-sensitive campaign or automation.\nTo request the latest segment data in a multitouch campaign, choose the publish setting Immediately before running this flow in Flow Builder. This setting adds a publish to your regular segment schedule that updates the segment before starting a flow.\nOther required automated processes, such as identity resolution, make your latest data available for use in a segment. When you’ve recently updated many records, consider the timing of these processes before you use a segment. The final population of a segment can be affected depending on when these processes finish and when a message is sent.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
