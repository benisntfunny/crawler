Because customer sending patterns vary greatly, we developed parameter sets that are suited for different patterns. During training, a parameter selector determines the chosen set for a particular business.\n\nEinstein Send Time Optimization uses global model data to train the model. Contributed data is anonymized and aggregated at both the business unit and contact levels before being used in local orgs. In this way, the global model can be used without sharing personal data, such as email addresses, between customer business units. When you enable Einstein Send Time Optimization, you automatically are opted-in to use global models.\n\nEinstein Send Time Optimization analyzes the past 90 days of email engagement history.\n\nIntended Use\n\nThe primary intended use for the Einstein Send Time Optimization model is for marketing professionals to increase effectiveness in their email marketing campaigns and maximize customer engagement. Anything else is out of scope and not recommended. For example, reducing overall send latency for reservation booking emails isn’t an intended use case.\n\nRelevant Factors\n\nThese factors are associated with the Einstein Send Time Optimization model.\n\nModel Input\n\nThe engagement history includes these values.\n\nEmail sends, bounces, and engagement events including opens, clicks, unsubscribes, spam complaints, and associated timestamps\nData and metadata about customer sending patterns, including how campaigns are executed\n\nThe engagement history that Einstein Send Time Optimization analyzes excludes these factors.\n\nData purchased or collected from third parties\nDemographic data\nSpecific content in an email template or rendered email body\nTransactional emails, such as purchase confirmations, password resets, and others\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe model is trained and deployed in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Growth environment.\n\nMetrics\n\nEinstein evaluates and monitors model performance metrics to ensure and improve the model quality. Customers are responsible for monitoring the model’s accuracy.\n\nModel Performance Measures\n\nAggregated model performance metrics are gathered to monitor, ensure, and improve the quality of the model. Model performance metrics include the spread and sparsity of input metrics and the correlation of output scores to historical observations. All metrics are aggregated and anonymized.\n\nTraining Data\n\nEinstein Send Time Optimization is trained using a global model of in-house data and outsourced data. Data from one Salesforce customer doesn’t affect the behavior for another Salesforce customer. Each version of the model uses the global model data with optimized sample weights customized for each customer.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nTo avoid bias and other ethical risks, the Einstein STO model doesn’t include demographic data.\n\nRefresh Cadence\n\nEinstein Send Time Optimization scores and models for email are updated approximately weekly. The refresh cadence varies by one to several days based on a customer's individual business unit.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
