But there might be some aspects of your implementation that require a little attention for best results in the new interface. Use the Lightning Experience Readiness Report, the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter, and good old fashioned testing to figure out where things stand.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nLeverage the usage data in the Readiness Report and the Configuration Converter to decide if an issue is worth your effort. For example, if you have custom JavaScript buttons but no one is using them, why bother converting them for Lightning Experience?\n\nIf there’s work to do, check out the transition tools at your disposal. These tools lighten your workload by streamlining steps or automating adjustments.\n\nGet Started with the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter\nThe Lightning Experience Configuration Converter is a standalone tool that lives outside of Salesforce. It helps you prepare your org for Lightning Experience by streamlining or automating common transition tasks.\nMove Actions and Buttons to Lightning Experience\nThe Lightning Experience Configuration Converter scans your org for actions and buttons. You can move all the actions and buttons at once, or let Salesforce guide you through the move process for each object.\nConvert JavaScript Buttons and Links into Lightning Experience Alternatives\nUncomfortable with code? Stymied by JavaScript? Don’t worry. With just a few clicks in the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter, you can recreate many JavaScript buttons and links as Lightning components, quick actions, or other declarative solutions.\nUpdate References to Hard-Coded URLs for Lightning Experience\nSome hard-coded references to your org’s original URL won’t work after you enable My Domain. Use the Hard-Coded URLs' tab in the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter to locate your hard-coded URLs, and then update them with a single click.\nPrepare Your Visualforce Pages for Lightning Experience\nScan your Visualforce pages to identify issues that may affect your transition to Lightning Experience. Visualforce pages are grouped by profile and prioritized by greatest user impact. Apply the Lightning look and feel to one or more Visualforce pages automatically with Lightning Experience Stylesheets, no code required. Always test your Visualforce page in Lightning Experience first—most work as-is. If the listed issue prevents the page from working properly, follow the instructions to tweak the markup. If a Visualforce page requires significant refactoring, move it to Lightning Components.\nReview AppExchange Packages for Lightning Experience Compatibility\nScan your installed package metadata and prepare your AppExchange packages for Lightning Experience. Find out which packages are ready to go. Get recommendations on updating, replacing, or verifying the rest.\nConvert Attachments and Classic Notes\nDoes your org use attachments and notes? In Lightning Experience, users get a better experience if you convert existing attachments to Salesforce Files and classic notes to enhanced notes. You can automate this conversion work with the handy Magic Mover for Notes and Attachments tool.\nMigrate Your Classic Knowledge Base to Lightning Knowledge\nIf your company uses Classic Knowledge, Lightning Experience users must switch to Salesforce Classic to do things like find or create Knowledge articles. Moving your Classic knowledge base into Lightning Knowledge gives your users a seamless experience and much better workflow. When you’re ready, the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool does most of the heavy lifting for you.\nPro Tips for Your Lightning Experience Implementation\nGive users a smooth transition to Lightning Experience by making sure the important and necessary parts of your classic implementation are available in the new interface. Here are some tips for integrating your org’s data and business-critical customizations with Lightning Experience features. We’ll look at ways to avoid common gotchas and work around some of the issues that may have you stumped.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
