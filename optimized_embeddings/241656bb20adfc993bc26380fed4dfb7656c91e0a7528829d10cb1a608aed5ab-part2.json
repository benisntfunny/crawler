Before you upgrade to Hyperforce, review our recommended prerequisite actions.\n\nUsing a phased rollout, Salesforce identifies Hyperforce-compatible orgs based on several requirements. When your org is eligible to upgrade, you’re notified several months in advance so that you have time to prepare. For more information about eligibility and answers to common questions, see Salesforce Help: Introducing Hyperforce - General Information & FAQ.\n\nThis topic outlines the most common preparation steps. For detailed recommendations, including less common requirements, see Retain Uninterrupted Access to Salesforce Services on Hyperforce.\n\nUse Hyperforce Assistant to help ensure that your upgrade goes smoothly. Remember to test changes in a sandbox.\n\nACTION\tREASON\nRemove hard-coded instance references.\tReferences to your instance (for example, https://NA1.salesforce.com) aren't valid on Hyperforce. To prevent links breaking after the upgrade, use generic URLs or relative references in integrations, templates, and customizations.\nReplace IP allowlists with modern security mechanisms such as mTLS so that Salesforce can access your corporate network.\tWhen IPs are added or changed, you can experience connection interruptions until you update your allowlist. On Hyperforce, IP additions and changes are frequent, so reliance on fragile allowlists introduces risk. If you must allowlist, see Hyperforce External IPs.\nAdd Salesforce domains to your allowlist to access Salesforce from your corporate network.\tHyperforce infrastructure is refreshed frequently, and IP addresses can change often. Add Salesforce domains to your allowlist and reduce allowlist maintenance without compromising security.\nReplace email IP address filtering with email security mechanisms such as SPF or DKIM.\tNew Salesforce IP addresses are constantly being added. If you filter emails by Salesforce IP addresses, there’s a chance of inadvertently not receiving an email from a new IP address.\nAdd a Service Name Indicator (SNI) to TLS ClientHello message.\tFor increased security, each domain has a unique HTTPS certificate. Add an SNI and ensure that you receive the correct certificate.\nUse or upgrade to .NET version 5.0 for Platform Events and Streaming Clients.\tCookies are handled to follow current HTTP state management guidance. If you use Platform Events or Streaming Clients and are on a .NET version before 5.0, a 403 error can appear.\nDisable pinned certificates in the mobile application and remove pinned certificates from custom configurations.\tHyperforce always uses SSL and mTLS, and rotates its certificates regularly. Relying on pinned certificates risks outages.\nProperly encode non-ASCII characters in URIs.\tHyperforce operates in strict compliance with the internet standards in RFC-3986. If you don’t properly encode URIs, you can receive an error code when you make API calls.\nUpdate target hostnames for custom domains served by a third-party service or content delivery network (CDN).\tYour target hostname changes when you move to Hyperforce. You must update the target hostname on the third-party or CDN, otherwise customers can’t reach your custom domain.\nSEE ALSO\nRetain Uninterrupted Access to Salesforce Services on Hyperforce\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
