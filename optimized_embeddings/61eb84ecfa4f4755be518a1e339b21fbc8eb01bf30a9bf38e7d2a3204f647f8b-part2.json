Don’t worry if you don’t have Visualforce experience—the workarounds show you exactly what to do each step of the way. Always test your Visualforce page in Lightning Experience first—most work as-is. If the listed issue is preventing the page from working properly, follow the instructions to tweak the markup and make it work. If a Visualforce page requires significant refactoring, move it to a Lightning component.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nThese workarounds are meant to guide you in the right direction. If you're unable to find a working solution, post questions to the Lightning Exp Configuration Converter group in the Trailblazer Community. Use the #VisualforceInLightning hashtag to call on our experts.\n\nReconfigure iframe Components\nWhen a URL is displayed in an inline frame (iframe) on a Visualforce page, it can cause errors in Lightning Experience. Sometimes your URL looks different than you want, or maybe the whole page doesn't load in Lightning Experience. Most iframes are compatible with Visualforce in Lightning Experience. However, if you preview your Visualforce page in Lightning Experience and don't like what you see, you can usually fix it.\nReplace the window.location Method\nThe window.location variable is a JavaScript method used to redirect the browser to a new page. JavaScript code in a Visualforce page that sets window.location directly isn't compatible with Lightning Experience. That's the bad news. The good news is that sforce.one navigation methods do the same thing, and are compatible with Lightning Experience.\nReplace Static URLs\nLightning Experience doesn't support the use of static URLs to link to Salesforce resources. Fortunately, there's a much better alternative that future proofs your URLs. URLFOR is a function that calculates a URL based on inputs, rather than relying on something static that can't change. Use the URLFOR function with the appropriate action instead of direct URLs.\nApply Lightning Stylesheets to Visualforce Pages Manually\nWith Lightning stylesheets, it’s easy to tweak your existing Visualforce pages so they’ll display with classic styling in Salesforce Classic and Lightning styling in Lightning Experience.\nSEE ALSO\nCheck Your Org’s Readiness for Lightning Experience\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
