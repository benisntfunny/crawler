Users who weren’t previously using MFA are prompted to register for it the next time they log in and can’t proceed until they do so. Users who were already logging in with MFA aren’t affected. For some products, MFA will be auto-enabled several months prior to enforcement. During this time, admins can temporarily disable MFA if their users aren’t ready for it yet. See also Enforce MFA and Register for MFA.\nAuthentication\nThe process of validating that a user is who they say they are before they’re allowed to log into an account, perform an action, or access information.\nEnable MFA\nThe action that customer admins take to turn on MFA for their org/tenant/realm. Depending on the Salesforce product, admins can enable MFA at the org level, for groups of users, or on a user-by-user basis.\nEnforce MFA\nWhen Salesforce enforces MFA for a Salesforce product, it becomes a permanent part of the product’s login process. During enforcement, Salesforce auto-enables MFA for all users who aren’t already using it for direct logins. At the same time, Salesforce removes the option for all customer users, including admins, to disable MFA.\nLeast Privilege\nThe concept that a user should have the fewest number of permissions necessary to do their job — and nothing more. This limits the risk of a user accessing information or performing an action that shouldn’t be allowed given their role, limits the impact of user errors, and reduces the damage of compromised credentials in the event of an attack.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA)\nA security measure used to increase protection for accessing user accounts. MFA requires users to present two or more pieces of evidence — or factors — during login to prove they’re who they say they are. These pieces of evidence must fall into at least two different categories (something a user knows, has, or is). A familiar example of MFA at work is the two factors needed to withdraw money from an ATM. To withdraw funds, you must first present your ATM card (something you have), and then you must enter your PIN (something you know). See also Verification Method.\nPrivileged User\nAdmins and users who have a high level of access to the application or sensitive data.\nFor products built on the Salesforce Platform, a privileged user is a Salesforce admin (defined as a user with both the Customize Application and Modify All Data user permissions) or a user with any of these user permissions: Customize Application, Manage Users, Modify All Data, or View All.\nRegister for MFA\nThe process each user goes through to connect a verification method to their account so they can use the method to verify their identity when logging in. When MFA is enabled, users are required to register a method before they can log in. Users can register multiple methods so they have backup options in case they lose or forget their primary method.\nSecurity Keys\nA physical device that electronically authenticates a person’s identity by storing and retrieving some sort of personal information. Security keys come in many different form factors, including USB, Lightning, and NFC. Also referred to as a security token or authentication token.\nStrong Verification Method\nVerification methods that are more resistant to cyberattacks, such as phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. These types of methods help provide high assurance that users accessing Salesforce products are who they say they are. See also Verification Method.\nTime-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)\nSingle-use passcodes that can be used as a verification method to authenticate a user to their account. To make use of a TOTP, a user must use a TOTP authenticator app, which generates the single-use passcodes. When a user is authenticating to their account, the generator implements an algorithm to create a one-time passcode based on the current time. Once displayed to the user, this password is valid for a limited time until it expires, at which time it is no longer valid for login and the user must request a new password.\nTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA)\nA subset of multi-factor authentication (MFA) that requires only two factors to log in. Both 2FA and MFA protect against unauthorized access by requiring a user to provide multiple factors to verify their identity. The difference between them is the number of factors that are needed to log in. While some MFA solutions may require three, four, or more combinations of factors, 2FA requires only two.\nVerification Method\nA piece of evidence that a user presents when logging in to verify their identity. Also referred to as a factor or authentication factor.\nSalesforce products support several types of verification methods, including Salesforce Authenticator, third-party TOTP authenticator apps (such as Google Authenticator or Authy), physical security keys, and built-in authenticators (such as Windows Hello, TouchID, or FaceID).
