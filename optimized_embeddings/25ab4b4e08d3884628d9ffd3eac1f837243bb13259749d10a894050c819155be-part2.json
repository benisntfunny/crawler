You typically use an outbound change set for customizations created and tested in a sandbox and that are then sent to a production org.\n\nREQUIRED USER PERMISSIONS\nUSER\nPERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create, edit, or upload outbound change sets:\tCreate and Upload Change Sets\n\nWatch a Demo:  Release Management: Deploying Changes Using Change Sets (Salesforce Classic)\n\nA change set can have up to 10,000 files with a total file size of 400 MB. Change set components are represented as metadata XML files. Make sure that your change set doesn’t exceed approximately 5,000 components.\n\nSending an outbound change set to another org doesn’t guarantee that the changes are implemented in that org. The change set must be deployed by the target org before the changes can take effect. To help ensure a smooth deployment, review information about permission sets and profile settings in change sets.\n\nAfter you upload a change set, its status becomes closed, and you can’t make changes to its components. Also, the components in a closed change set don’t get refreshed. To redeploy the same set of components, clone the change set. The cloned change set includes the latest changes to its components source. You can add and remove components in the cloned change set. Cloning change sets is helpful during the iterative phases of a project.\n\nSelect Components for an Outbound Change Set\nYou typically use an outbound change set for customizations created and tested in a sandbox and that are then sent to a production org.\nView and Add Dependent Components to a Change Set\nA dependency is a relationship where one or more components must exist for another component to exist. Add dependent components to a change set, unless the dependent components exist in every org where this change set is deployed.\nUpload an Outbound Change Set\nWhen you've assembled the components in a change set, you can upload it to another Salesforce org. After you upload a change set, you can't edit it or recall it.\nCreate an Outbound Change Set\nAn outbound change set is a change you send from the Salesforce org you are logged into to another org.\nClone an Outbound Change Set\nYou can create a copy of an existing change set by cloning it.\nDelete an Outbound Change Set\nYou can locate outbound via the Quick Find box.\nOutbound Change Set Validation Errors\nIf you receive an error about cross-version validation, the org used to create the outbound change set is running on a different version than the destination org.\nUpload Change Sets During Staggered Salesforce Service Upgrades\nDuring Salesforce service upgrades, production and sandbox environments don't always run the same version of the platform because the upgrades are staggered. Some components may have new functionality that prevents you from deploying that type of component. You can deploy such components after the production org runs the same version as sandbox.\nSEE ALSO\nPermission Sets and Profile Settings in Change Sets\nInbound Change Sets\nChange Sets\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
