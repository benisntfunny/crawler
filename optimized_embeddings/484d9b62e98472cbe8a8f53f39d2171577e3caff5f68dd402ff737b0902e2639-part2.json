These short code/A2P programs must comply with a basic code of conduct that promotes the best possible user experience.\n\nBelow you will find a guide and timeline for the short code application process.\n\n \n\nStep 1: Review Considerations and Purchase a Short Code\n\nReview Considerations for Short Code SMS Messaging Channels in Salesforce Help.\nPurchase a short code through your account executive. Because short codes can’t be migrated from an enhanced SMS channel in sandbox to an enhanced SMS channel in production, request separate short codes for sandbox and production.\n\n \n\nStep 2: Complete Application Prework (1-2 Weeks)\n\nProvide information for your short code application in the Campaign Application Form: https://salesforce.quip.com/aG4aAvUkUwDL. If you have access to Quip, create a copy of the form and complete it. If you don’t have Quip access, copy the form contents into the spreadsheet editor of your choice.\n\nThe Campaign Application Form is an industry requirement. Required fields are highlighted in blue. If they aren’t completed, Salesforce can’t submit your application. You’ll also find instructions and links to helpful articles. In the application, you will provide:\n\nCompany info, contact info, and basic information about the campaign.\nA call to action (CTA) and sample alert. Mockup CTAs for web are acceptable, as long as the final is completed before your application is submitted for carrier testing.\nOpt-in, double opt-in, opt-out, and help keywords and responses.\nSupport contact information.\nProposed updates to your Terms of Service (ToS) to include texting terms. The proposed ToS don’t need to be live on the site where they will ultimately be published, but carriers must be able to access them or a mockup during testing. \n\nFor help completing this form, see Campaign Application Form (CAF) template preparation instructions.\n\nFor help drafting updates to your Terms and Conditions, see Service Cloud - Digital Engagement: Short Code Application: ToS & Privacy Policy. While this article provides example updates, YOU MUST consult your internal legal department to make sure the updated terms adhere to your company’s guidelines.\n\n \n\nStep 3: Contact the Short Code Enablement Team\n\nEmail ShortCodeEnablement@salesforce.com with the following details:\n\nYour company name\nYour account number or org ID\nYour Campaign Application Form and any associated prework\n\nA member of our team will review your prework and work with you to fine-tune your application.\n\n \n\nStep 4: Set Up Your Channel in a Sandbox\n\nThe short code enablement team will work with you to set up your short code in your org. Please provide this information:\n\nSandbox org ID\nShort code number\nYour contact information\nWhen Salesforce notifies you that your short code channel was created, update your channel settings.\nIn your sandbox, complete the steps in Prepare for WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Apple Messages, and SMS in Salesforce Help.\nIn Setup, enter Messaging in the Quick Find box, and select Messaging Settings.\nFind your short code channel in the list. Click the dropdown arrow next to your channel, and then click Edit.\nIn the Automated Responses section, complete all opt-in, double opt-in, opt-out, help, and custom fields. For help completing these fields, see Customize Auto-Responses in Service Cloud Messaging Channels in Salesforce Help.\nSave your changes.\n\nImportant: When you use short codes, your business is required to follow carrier compliance requirements, industry standards, and applicable law. The CTIA sometimes audits short code Messaging channels. To learn more, see the CTIA Short Code Monitoring Handbook and Canadian Common Short Codes.\n\nAfter your channel settings are updated, let your Salesforce point of contact know so the submission process can begin.\n\n \n\nStep 5: Submit Application and Complete Carrier Testing (6-8 Weeks)\n\nIn this step, your Salesforce point of contact works with our partner and provides your answers to the carriers from the completed Campaign Application Form.\n\nSalesforce submits the short code for carrier testing. \nThe carriers test the short code and let Salesforce know once traffic is being routed to the short code. Each carrier tests individually, based on their current backlog.\n\nNote: This is the lengthiest part of the process and can take up to 8 weeks to complete, as each of the 55+ carriers in the ecosystem must review and approve the application. Issues identified by any carrier and/or requests for more information can significantly delay the date that the short code is considered \"launched\" and ready for use.\n\nYour Salesforce point of contact alerts you after all carriers approve your application.\n\n \n\nStep 6: Go Live in Production (1 Week)\n\nWhen you are ready to go live, Salesforce moves your short code channel from sandbox to production. \n\nCreate a case in Salesforce Help to have your short code migrated to your production environment. In your case, provide:\nThe short code \nThe org ID where the code will be migrated to\nYour contact information\nYour preference for when to perform the migration (for example, at a low-traffic time)\nSalesforce migrates the short code to production.\nWhen Salesforce notifies you that your short code channel was created, update your channel settings in production.\nIn your sandbox, complete the steps in Prepare for WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Apple Messages, and SMS in Salesforce Help.\nIn Setup, enter Messaging in the Quick Find box, and select Messaging Settings.\nFind your short code channel in the list. Click the dropdown arrow next to your channel, and then click Edit.\nIn the Automated Responses section, complete all opt-in, double opt-in, opt-out, help, and custom fields. For help completing these fields, see Customize Auto-Responses in Service Cloud Messaging Channels in Salesforce Help.\nSave your changes.\n\n \n\nYour short code is now live and ready for use.\n\nKnowledge Article Number\n\n000380702\n\nAttachments\nCAF Form - Template.xlsx\nCAF Form - Template.xlsx\n\n17 KB\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
