You can choose to manually merge two or more accounts.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: All Editions\nNOTE A Trailblazer account is available to AppExchange, Commerce Cloud Developer Center, Events, IdeaExchange, Salesforce Help, Salesforce+, Trailblazer Community, Trailhead users, and Partner Community.\nSelf-Service Account Merges\n\nIf you have two or more Salesforce-related identities and want to combine them into one, you can perform a self-service account merge.\n\nWhen merging multiple accounts, Trailblazer combines:\n\nA self-service account merge doesn’t use or deploy any permissions sets, profiles, or other security settings from the connected Salesforce instance. A merge doesn’t allow access to any of the data or metadata stored in Salesforce.\n\nIMPORTANT A merge is irreversible and accounts can’t be separated after they’re merged. If your accounts were merged but your account details aren’t correct, refresh your browser. Still not working? Submit a case.\nTips for Working with Many Salesforce Accounts\n\nThe number of Salesforce accounts that a Trailblazer interacts with varies by role. Some Trailblazers interact with only one or a few Salesforce accounts. For example, they have a personal account for Trailhead challenges and another for their workplace. Other Trailblazers interact with many Salesforce accounts. For example, they perform Salesforce consulting work and log in to multiple orgs on behalf of clients each day. In the latter scenario, visiting sites that use a Trailblazer account, such as visiting AppExchange to install a package, can result in regular account merge requests. Account merges add your Salesforce account as a login method to your Trailblazer account. Data in each Salesforce account remains separate. Over time, a Trailblazer profile can accumulate many unwanted or infrequently used Salesforce accounts.\n\nIf you interact with many Salesforce accounts for your job, visit your Trailblazer profile periodically and delete the accounts that you don’t use often. Your profile’s connected Salesforce accounts appear on your Trailblazer profile settings page.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Help—Trailblazer and Multi-Org Experience\nSalesforce Help—Trailblazer Recovery Accounts\nSalesforce Help—Set Up a Trailblazer Recovery Account\nMerge Trailblazer Accounts\n\nTo combine two separate Salesforce-related accounts into one Trailblazer account, you can perform a self-service account merge.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: All Editions\nNOTE A Trailblazer account is available to AppExchange, Commerce Cloud Developer Center, Events, IdeaExchange, Salesforce Help, Salesforce+, Trailblazer Community, Trailhead users, and Partner Community.\nIMPORTANT A merge is irreversible, and accounts can’t be separated after they’re merged.\n\nBefore you begin, identify which account is primary and which is secondary. Your primary account is the one you want all the activity data (like badges, activity history, and votes) to appear in. All activity data from the secondary account moves to the primary account, excluding duplicate data. If your secondary account has other login identities associated with it—like a Salesforce, social, or email account—they’re merged, as well. Merging is an irreversible process—you don’t have access to your secondary account after the merge.\n\nNOTE If your secondary account is linked to your certification Webassessor account, the link breaks. To see those certifications on your primary account, link Trailhead and Webassessor again. If Webassessor is linked to your primary account, nothing breaks.\n\nTo merge your accounts:\n\nLog in to Trailblazer with your primary account.\nClick your profile image in the top-right corner and select Settings from the dropdown.\nClick Connect an Account, and log in with your secondary account.\nComplete the merge.\nEXAMPLE\n\nYou’re all done!\n\nIf your accounts were merged but your account details aren’t correct, refresh your browser. Still not working?
