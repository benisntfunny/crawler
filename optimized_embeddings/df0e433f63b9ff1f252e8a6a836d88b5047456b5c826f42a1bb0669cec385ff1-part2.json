A Salesforce Admin or user who is assigned the DevOps Center Manager permission set can configure DevOps Center.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Enterprise, Performance, Professional, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\nAvailable in: Government Cloud Plus as interoperable. Turning on DevOps Center in Government Cloud Plus orgs can send data outside the authorization boundary. Contact your Salesforce account executive for more details.\nNot available in: EU Operating Zone. EU Operating zone is a special paid offering that provides an enhanced level of data residency commitment. DevOps Center is supported in orgs in the EU that are not part of EU OZ, per standard product terms and conditions.\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo install and configure DevOps Center:\t“Download AppExchange Packages”\nIMPORTANT You can’t install DevOps Center in a sandbox.\n\nInstall the DevOps Center package in a supported org edition from the DevOps Center Setup page. You can install DevOps Center in the org that is the final release org in your pipeline, or in another org that is unrelated to the orgs in the pipeline. After you install it, you connect DevOps Center to any environments that you use for development, testing, and final release.\n\nAs part of the configuration process, you add DevOps Center users in the org in which it’s installed. You can provide minimum access to the org by assigning users either the Identity Only or Salesforce Limited Access - Free license. Then you assign users to DevOps Center permission sets that determine what tasks they can perform in the DevOps Center app.\n\nWhy Can’t I Install DevOps Center in a Sandbox?\n\nDevOps Center is a managed package that is installed in an org that acts as a “hub” for the application. From within DevOps Center, you connect to your development orgs, pipeline environments, and release orgs. DevOps Center doesn’t interact with the existing data in the org, yet generates data in the form of custom object records for the custom objects delivered with the package.\n\nWe don’t provide the ability to install DevOps Center in sandboxes because:\n\nSandbox refreshes result in the loss of DevOps Center projects and their associated records. All your DevOps Center data will be gone.\nIt’s designed so that all team members log in to the same org to access DevOps Center. Cloning a sandbox would result in multiple instances of the managed package, which can lead to confusion and synchronization issues for teams expecting to be working against the same projects.\nUnlike some other packages, DevOps Center has no interaction with existing data or metadata in your org.\n\nTo evaluate DevOps Center, enable and install it in a Developer Edition org or a scratch org. However, remember that scratch orgs expire.\n\nProvide General Feedback\n\nTo provide general feedback, request product enhancements, start discussions with other DevOps Center users or the product team, and share best practices, use the DevOps Center Trailblazer group.\n\nDevOps Center Releases\nBased on your feedback and our drive for innovation, the DevOps Center team releases new features, product enhancements, and bug fixes on a regular basis. If you want to know all the goodness included in each package version, you’ve come to the right place.\nEvaluate DevOps Center in a Non-Production Org\nSo you want to evaluate DevOps Center, but prefer to install it in an org other than your production org. Have no fear. You have options. You can completely evaluate DevOps Center using a combination of Developer Edition (DE) orgs and scratch orgs.\nEnable and Install DevOps Center in the Org\nEnable DevOps Center to provide the permissions needed to install the DevOps Center package in the org. You can install DevOps Center in the org that is the final release org in your pipeline, or in another org that is unrelated to the orgs in the pipeline.\nUpgrade to the Latest DevOps Center Version\nIn most cases, you don’t have to do anything to upgrade to the latest version of the DevOps Center. When we release a new package version, we update your org automatically.\nConfigure DevOps Center\nAs the administrator, you can add team members, set up projects, add environments, configure your pipeline, and create work items.\nManage DevOps Center Projects\nYour team’s central arena for work in DevOps Center is the project. The purpose of a project is to help you and your team manage changes being developed for a particular application.\nManage Environments\nWhen first configuring DevOps Center, identify the environments that you’re going to use for each project. After environments are defined in the Pipeline Environments tab, you can manage each environment from its drop-down menu.\nPlan Your Pipeline\nA pipeline defines the sequence of stages that work items progress as they go through the release lifecycle from development through to production (or some other final release stage).\nCreate and Assign Project Work Items\nCreate work items so that when your team members open DevOps Center for the first time, project work is already identified and assigned to them.\nBuild an Extension Package for DevOps Center\nSalesforce partners and ISVs can use scratch orgs as their dev environments when building managed second-generation (2GP) extension packages that expand the functionality of DevOps Center. An extension is any package, component, or set of components that adds to the functionality of a managed package. An extension requires that the base managed package is installed in the org.\nUninstall DevOps Center\nYou can uninstall DevOps Center, if necessary. If you plan to reinstall DevOps Center, don't delete the DevOps Center auth providers. However, if you deleted the auth providers, you can recreate them by re-enabling the DevOps Center preference in Setup.\nTroubleshoot DevOps Center Configuration\nHere are some tips if you encounter issues when installing or configuring DevOps Center.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Help: Manage and Release Changes Easily and Collaboratively with DevOps Center\nDevOps Center Developer Guide\nUninstall DevOps Center\nTrailhead: Git and GitHub Basics\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
