Expression sets accept JSON input from and return JSON output to the digital processes that call the sets.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions for Industries clouds that have Business Rules Engine enabled\n\nAn expression set can have multiple versions with different step elements. Each version is required to have a start date time and a rank, and if necessary, an end date time. Multiple versions of an expression set can be enabled simultaneously. When more than one enabled version matches an expression set call, and the date time periods overlap, the version with the highest rank is chosen. For example, if two enabled versions have rank 1 and rank 2, the version with rank 2 is chosen.\n\nExpression Set Resources\nExpression set versions can have these resource types: variables and constants. Define and use variables—the placeholders for dynamic values—and constants—the placeholders for fixed values—in expression sets for inputs, outputs, and values passed between steps. Numeric variables and constants follow specific assignment rules.\nObject Variables in Expression Sets\nUse fields from objects as variables in an expression set. To use object fields as variables in expression sets, the fields must have field aliases defined. You can either use the field aliases available in your org, or have your admins create aliases for the objects fields that you plan to use in an expression set. Aliases are relevant and user-friendly names that are created for underlying source object fields. Field aliases are grouped under an object alias. Object and field aliases are created in Setup and are categorized by a usage type. When you create or modify an expression set, the field aliases related to the expression set’s usage type are available to you as variables in the expression set.\nList Variables in Expression Sets\nWith the integration of Context Service with Business Rules Engine, you can use attribute tags from context definitions as list variables in expression sets. When you create an expression set, select a context definition that’s available in your Salesforce org to associate the definition with the expression set. When you open a version of the expression set in Expression Set Builder, you see the context’s tags as list variables in the Resources list in the builder.\nSupported Data Types in Expression Sets\nExpression set versions support resources of specific data types. A resource’s data type determines the operators that can be used with the resource.\nOperators and Functions in Expression Sets\nFormulas in expression sets support logical, comparison, mathematical, and string operators, and functions for dates and numbers.\nStep Elements to Build Your Expression Sets\nStep elements are the building blocks of an expression set. A new expression set version is always blank. Each element forms a step in an expression set. Use the elements in the Expression Set Builder to form logical steps in the expression set. Steps in an expression set run sequentially. Depending on the type of the step element, a step can perform calculations, lookups, or condition evaluations that determine how the next step in the expression set is processed.\nExpression Set Templates\nAn expression set template is a file-based expression set with preconfigured steps that can run end-to-end. Expression set templates don’t have versions. The type of an expression set template determines whether the template is ready-to-use or read-only. An expression set template is available in your Salesforce org only if your Industries solution has shipped it. You can’t create an expression set template, but you can reuse it to build a new expression set or an expression set version.\nCreate An Expression Set\nCreating an expression set is a multistep process. When you create an expression set, the set's first version is created by default. Then, you configure the version and create variables and constants for inputs, outputs, and values that are used by and passed between the steps. Next, you add a logical sequence of steps that perform calculations or evaluate conditions using variables, constants, and decision matrices. After you create the flow, you simulate your expression set version with test values to verify that the set is working as expected, and then activate the expression set.\nHow to Create an Expression Set That Uses Context Definition\nThis example shows how to associate a context definition with an expression set, and how to use the definition’s tags as list variables in the expression set version. The example also shows how to verify if the expression set version works as expected.\nManage Expression Sets\nLearn how to clone an expression set, open an expression set version in the builder, and deactivate an expression set version.\nConsiderations for Migrating Expression Sets\nGenerally, expression sets are migrated to production orgs after they’re tested in the development and staging sandbox orgs, and verified to work as expected. The expression sets can contain references to dependent elements such as decision matrices, decision tables, subexpressions, context definitions, field and object aliases, and explainability message templates.\nExpression Sets for Developers\nDevelopers in your Salesforce org can employ expression set developer resources to use and extend expression sets.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
