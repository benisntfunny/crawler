These common requests and tips may help you determine how you might use Salesforce Platform features to work toward compliance with the regulations that apply to you.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: All Editions\n\nMany data protection and privacy regulations can require you and your company to delete customers’ personal data when customers request it, or when it’s no longer necessary for you to keep it. We’ve listed a few of the regulations that are important to many companies collecting and processing their customers’ data.\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European Union\nPersonal Information Protection Act (PIPA), Japan\nPrivacy Act, Australia\n\nIf you have customers or users who want the data that you’ve collected on them deleted, review these common requests and the procedures related to them. You can also review considerations in other sections of this guide for Salesforce products that may use the Salesforce Platform.\n\nCOMMON CUSTOMER REQUEST\tACTIONS TO CONSIDER\tTHINGS TO CONSIDER\nI’ve deleted sensitive data from my Production org, and now I want to delete that same data from my Full Copy Sandbox.\tRefresh Your Sandbox\tYou can manually delete the data from your sandbox. If you choose to refresh your sandbox to duplicate your production org, check with your development teams first. Otherwise, work may be lost. Also remove the data from any data sets that you’ve created for development and testing.\nAn employee’s left our company. I need remove their access to my org and delete all data associated with their login credentials.\t\nPasswords\nUse Activations\nUser Sessions\nConnected Apps\n\t\n\nIn addition to removing the user’s org access, consider:\n\nExpiring all passwords for that user\nRevoking activation status\nEnd usage tracking for Connected Apps\nRemove user sessions\n\nUsers and admins can also:\n\nDisconnect the user’s account from third-party accounts like Facebook\nChange the user’s password\n\nI'm an ISV and I want to be sure that some data is removed from package versions I published.\t\n\nTo remove data from package versions,\n\nCreate a version of the package with the information removed\nUse the existing push upgrade option to update all their customers to the new version of the package\nTo delete the original package version, file a ticket with Salesforce\n\t\nI want to find and delete data associated with a particular contact ID.\t\nFind information with reports\nBuild a flow that accepts a contact ID, finds all data associated with that contact ID, and deletes it. Learn how to build a flow.\n\tFlows might not identify all the data to delete. After your flow finishes, consider running a report to identify any remaining information and then delete it.\nAs a customer, I want to delete Event Monitoring data for a given user on request.\t\nLearn about deleting event logs.\n\t\n\nEvent Monitoring logs are treated as a single entity, which means you can't remove one single user's data from a log. Pinpoint the dates of the user's activity you want to delete. Then remove the logs in that date range.\n\nIf you want to retain some data from these logs, you can make backups of logs before deleting them. Then, after you delete a log, remove specific users’ data from your backups. Learn more about managing log files in the Event Monitoring Trailhead.\n\n\nI'd like to delete a user's history programmatically. Can I do that?\t\nDelete custom big objects through Setup.\nUse the deleteByExample( ) call to define an sObject that contains the fields and values you want to delete.\n\tThe deleteByExample( ) call can delete data in FieldHistoryArchive and custom big objects. Entire custom big objects can be deleted in Setup.\nI want to let Community or Chatter users deactivate their own accounts on demand.\t\nEnable the User Self Deactivate feature.\n\tProvide users with a mechanism to deactivate their accounts. You can create this mechanism declaratively or programmatically.\nA customer referenced in my flows asked us to delete all information about them. How can I make sure I've deleted all references to information that could personally identify this customer?\t\nManually remove the customer’s records from the flow.\nUse the $Flow.InterviewGuid variable to identify records that are saved when a flow is paused.\n\tWhen a flow is paused, the flow interviews serialize the data that the flow references. The serialized data is saved to the database as a Paused Flow Interview record. After you find these records, you can delete them as you would any other record.\nI want to delete a user and all the records associated with them.\t\nManually or programmatically delete the values in non-required fields.\nAnonymize data in required fields. For example, change an email address to “deleteduser@delete.myco.com.”\nDeactivate the User record by unchecking the Active field.\nDelete any third-party account links used for authentication.\n\t\nWhen deleting information about employees, the employee should ask Salesforce Customer Support to re-enable the default email change verification settings. This setting prevents them from receiving verification emails if you anonymize their data in required fields. Customers don’t receive verification emails, and don’t need to contact Salesforce Customer Support.\nConsider using Quick Actions to find information about customers like Customer Community or External Identity users. Go to the Contact record, choose to disable the user through the Quick Action, find the disabled User record, and then manually delete remaining values.\n\nI’m a developer, and I created an app that uses the Einstein Vision and Einstein Language APIs. A user of my app has requested that any personal data in the form of text or images be removed from any elements created by the API (such as examples, datasets, and models).\t\n\nAfter you delete the relevant data, use the Einstein Vision and Einstein Language APIs to delete the dataset. Then create anew dataset from the source data and consider whether to retrain the dataset to create a model.\n\nDelete a Dataset (Einstein Vision)\nDelete a Dataset (Einstein Language)\nCreate a Dataset From a File Asynchronously (Einstein Vision)\nCreate a Dataset From a File Asynchronously (Einstein Language)\nTrain a Dataset (Einstein Vision)\nTrain a Dataset (Einstein Language)\n\t\nSome customers requested that we delete text or image data sent in for prediction.\tPrediction data is deleted automatically within 48 hours.\t\nI want to delete my reaction to an Einstein Next Best Action recommendation.\tTo delete customer reactions, use Next Best Action, Reaction via Connect REST API.\t\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
