If service appointments can't be scheduled due to a lack of availability, higher priority work and other objectives in the scheduling policy determine which service appointments to schedule and which to drop.\nResource Schedule Optimization: Dispatchers can use this feature to reschedule appointments that overlap with other appointments or absences, for one service resource’s schedule, on any given date. This feature can schedule additional relevant work and attempt to further optimize a resource’s schedule in addition to fixing overlaps. If service appointments can't be scheduled due to a lack of availability, higher priority work and other objectives in the scheduling policy determine which service appointments to schedule and which to drop.\nIn-Day Optimization and Global Optimization: When running global optimization or in-day optimization, overlaps are fixed regardless of the status of the Fix Overlaps setting in the scheduling policy. Optimization always attempts to fix overlaps unless service appointments are pinned. If service appointments can't be scheduled due to a lack of availability, higher priority work and other objectives in the scheduling policy determine which service appointments to schedule and which to drop.\nFix Overlaps Features When Not Using Enhanced Scheduling and Optimization\n\nIf you’re not using Enhanced Scheduling and Optimization, several fix overlaps features are available.\n\nScheduling recipes: This feature provides several configurable, event-driven automations to trigger a Resource Schedule Optimization request. For example, you can create a scheduling recipe that triggers a Resource Schedule Optimization request when an appointment ends late and causes an overlap with another appointment. If service appointments can't be scheduled due to a lack of availability, higher priority work and other objectives in the scheduling policy determine which service appointments to schedule and which to drop.\nFix overlaps in the Gantt: Dispatchers can use this feature to reschedule appointments that overlap with other appointments or absences, for one service resource’s schedule. Overlapping appointments are rescheduled according to your configured settings. For example, choose whether unscheduled appointments are rescheduled in order of priority or keep the original schedule’s order. If Field Service can’t find a valid schedule for an appointment, you can define whether to put the appointment in jeopardy, unschedule it, or reshuffle other assignments. This feature doesn’t schedule any additional work or optimize a resource’s schedule. Fixing overlaps in the Gantt isn’t available when scheduling recipes are used.\nFix Overlaps in scheduling policies: If you select Fix Overlaps in a scheduling policy, service appointment overlaps are addressed during in-day or global optimization. Scheduling policies reschedule and fix service appointment overlaps for all resources in the optimized territories. Service appointments that overlap with resource absences are ignored. If service appointments can't be scheduled due to a lack of availability, higher priority work and other objectives in the scheduling policy determine which service appointments to schedule and which to drop.\nResource Schedule Optimization: Dispatchers can use this feature to reschedule appointments that overlap with other appointments or absences, for one service resource’s schedule, on any given day. This feature considers the service appointment’s priority value, and it can also schedule additional relevant work and attempt to further optimize a resource’s schedule in addition to fixing overlaps. If service appointments can't be scheduled due to a lack of availability, higher priority work and other objectives in the scheduling policy determine which service appointments to schedule and which to drop. \nUse Cases\n\nReview which feature to use for each use case and whether the feature is available with Enhanced Scheduling and Optimization.\n\nI WANT TO…\tWHAT STEPS DO I TAKE?\tAVAILABLE WHEN USING ENHANCED SCHEDULING AND OPTIMIZATION\tAVAILABLE WHEN NOT USING ENHANCED SCHEDULING AND OPTIMIZATION\tPERSONA\nManually fix overlapping appointments directly from the Gantt, causing a minimum amount of changes to the schedule\tFix Overlaps from the Dispatcher Console\t\t\tDispatcher\nReschedule appointments that overlap with other appointments or absences, for one service resource’s schedule.\tResource Schedule Optimization\t\t\tDispatcher\nAutomatically detect and fix scheduling overlaps on the Gantt.\tFix Schedule Overlaps flow (Beta)\t\t\tAdmin\nFix Overlaps Automatically\t\t\nScheduling Recipes\t\t\nFix overlaps while optimizing the schedule.\tOverlaps are always fixed when using enhanced optimization (Global, In-day or Resource Scheduling Optimization).\t\t\tAdmin\nIf you aren’t using enhanced optimization, use the Fix Overlaps option in the scheduling policy.\t\t\nResolve overlaps that occur when a mobile worker finishes an appointment late.\tFix Schedule Overlaps flow (Beta)\t\t\tAdmin\nScheduling recipes\t\t\nResolve overlaps created by emergency appointments.\tResource Schedule Optimization\t\t\tAdmin\nScheduling recipes\t\t\nSEE ALSO\nFix Field Service Scheduling Overlaps from the Dispatcher Console\nCustomize Fix Overlap Scheduling Settings\nOptimize Your Field Service Schedule\nReschedule Service Appointments in Field Service\nAdopt and Implement Field Service Enhanced Scheduling and Optimization\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
