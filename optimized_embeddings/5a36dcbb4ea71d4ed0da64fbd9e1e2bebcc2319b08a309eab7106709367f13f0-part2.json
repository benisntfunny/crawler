These apps include custom metadata, permission sets, Data Processing Engine templates, flow templates, and more. While you can easily access these apps using the Manufacturing Cloud learning trial org, the apps can be extended for other industry-specific implementations using Rebate Management.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions that have Rebate Management enabled.\nIMPORTANT The Manufacturing Cloud and Rebate Management Prebuilt Apps is a Non-SFDC Application as defined under, and subject to the terms of, your Main Services Agreement (f/k/a the Master Subscription Agreement) with Salesforce. https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/agreements.jsp\nWhat Are Prebuilt Apps for Rebate Management?\nUse prebuilt apps tailored for Rebate Management to implement custom business use cases. While some prebuilt apps can be deployed directly into a production or sandbox org as managed packages, for others, you can create a package in the learning trial org and install that package into your own org.\nSimplify Data Processing Engine Edits to Group and Aggregate Data\nThe Data Processing Engine Edits for Rebates prebuilt app helps you quickly map fields between Transaction Journal and Rebate Member Product Aggregate. Typically, you manually edit multiple nodes in a Data Processing Engine (DPE) definition to map similar fields on both objects. With this prebuilt app, you can use a point-and-click solution to map the group and aggregate fields for the Aggregate Payouts by Member with Aggregate Item Details definition. The app also helps you download the modified Data Processing Engine definition file. You can simply upload the modified file in the DPE builder to update the definition.\nCheck Rebate Calculations Using a Flow\nEliminate guesswork and rework by checking which transactions are considered in the rebate calculations by the Rebate Orchestration flow. Use the Check Rebate Calculations prebuilt app to quickly run a screen flow and find out which Transaction Journal records qualify for the final payout for a specific rebate member enrolled in a rebate program, and for a specific payout period. You can also find out which rebate types are applied to the transactions that qualify for payout.\nDebug Your Data Processing Engine Definitions for Rebate Management\nUse the Data Processing Engine Debug prebuilt app to add debug nodes to Data Processing Engine (DPE) definitions, and visualize the connections of nodes in a DPE definition. You can add debug nodes to specific nodes in a DPE definition to track the number of records processed by that node in a DPE definition. You can also get a visual representation of a DPE definition that shows how each node is connected with other nodes. The Data Processing Engine Debug app helps you monitor a DPE definition’s performance and plan customizations.\nSEE ALSO\nExtend Manufacturing Cloud with Prebuilt Apps\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
