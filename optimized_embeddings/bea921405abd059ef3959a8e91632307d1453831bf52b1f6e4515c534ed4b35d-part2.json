Let’s get you started by creating your own Trailblazer account so you can access Salesforce digital properties with a single login. It’s easy, and with it you can start blazing your own trail in no time.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: All Editions\nTrailblazer Account Overview\n\nA Trailblazer account gives you free, unified access to Salesforce digital properties to streamline your login experience. With a Trailblazer account you get the best of Salesforce, including AppExchange, Commerce Cloud Developer Center, Events, Idea Exchange, Salesforce Help, Salesforce+, Trailhead, Trailblazer Community, and Partner Community, all with a single login. Your account provides a unified login experience that lets you easily access the best of Salesforce.\n\nManage your settings, email preferences, and connected Salesforce accounts all from your Trailblazer account. The profile includes Trailhead badges, Salesforce certifications, event attendance, Trailblazer Community activities, and more. With the ability to connect your personal email to your account, your Trailblazer account and Trailblazer profile stay with you through your entire career journey.\n\nTrailblazer Account Sign Up and Log In\n\nFor detailed information about how to sign up, see Sign Up for a Trailblazer Account in Salesforce Help.\n\nWe recommend that you create a Trailblazer account with your personal email address so that if you change companies, you don’t lose access to your account. But after you create your account, you can add email addresses, such as your work email. For Partners accessing the Partner Community, use your Trailblazer login credentials for your Salesforce Partner company. After you log in to the Partner Community with Trailblazer, you can access Partner Learning Camp and Talent Alliance. You can also add a Salesforce account, MuleSoft, Tableau, and social accounts, such as Google and LinkedIn, by updating your Trailblazer account settings.\n\nVisit digital.salesforce.com/login. Then log in with any of your connected accounts.\n\nYou can also log in to your Trailblazer account from Trailhead, AppExchange, Salesforce+, and other parts of the Salesforce website.\n\nTrailblazer Profile\n\nThe Trailblazer profile shows your experience, accomplishments, and learning across your Salesforce communities. Your Trailblazer profile also showcases your engagement with Salesforce, including Trailblazer Community connections, questions and answers, and an optional career bio.\n\nYou can update your profile privacy in your Trailblazer profile settings. From your Trailblazer profile, in the upper-right corner, click the pencil icon  next to your name. When your profile is set to public, anyone can view your profile. When it is set to private, only you can see your profile.\n\nTrailblazer Account Settings\n\nTo manage your Trailblazer account settings, log into your Trailblazer account, click your photo, and select Settings from the menu. You can manage these settings.\n\nConnect Salesforce accounts, such as production, Developer Edition, or Playground accounts.\nConnect MuleSoft and Tableau login.\nAdd email addresses, such as work and personal email addresses.\nConnect social accounts, such as LinkedIn and Google.\nSet your email preferences.\nManage your physical address.\nChange your profile privacy settings.\nDelete your account.\nRegister for Salesforce Events with a Trailblazer Account\n\nYou can register for Salesforce events through the corresponding events page. When following the registration flow, you’re prompted to log in to or sign up for your Trailblazer account. Follow the on-screen instructions and complete your registration.\n\nWhy does Trailblazer merge my accounts?\n\nThe goal of your Trailblazer account is to create a unified account for a consistent experience across many of Salesforce’s digital properties. If you have multiple Salesforce-related accounts with the same email address or you signed up for multiple Trailblazer accounts, you can choose to merge them into a single identity and set of credentials.\n\nFor example, you previously logged in to your Trailblazer account with an email address, and you later log in from a social account that uses the same email address. Trailblazer merges them so that you can use either account to log in, saving you from managing multiple accounts.\n\nWhy is my Trailblazer account merged incorrectly?\n\nYour Trailblazer accounts are merged based on the email addresses associated with your login credentials. For example, if you shared your Salesforce login credentials with a colleague, it can result in your Trailblazer accounts merging with the shared details. We recommend that you never share Salesforce login credentials with anyone.\n\nHow can I manage multiple Salesforce accounts?\n\nThe number of Salesforce accounts that a Trailblazer interacts with varies by role. Some Trailblazers interact with only one or a few Salesforce accounts. For example, they have a personal account for Trailhead challenges and another for their workplace. Other Trailblazers interact with many Salesforce accounts. For example, they perform Salesforce consulting work and log in to multiple Salesforce accounts on behalf of clients each day. To access the Partner Community, use the Trailblazer login credentials for your Salesforce Partner company.\n\nVisiting sites that use Trailblazer accounts, such as AppExchange to install a package, can result in automatic Trailblazer account merges. Account merges consolidate your various Salesforce accounts as a login method to your Trailblazer account. Data in each Salesforce account remains separate.\n\nIf you interact with many Salesforce accounts and want to disassociate some of them that you use less often from your profile, periodically delete accounts from your Trailblazer Account Settings.\n\nTo combine two separate Salesforce-related accounts into one Trailblazer account, you can perform a self-service account merge. For instructions, see Merge Trailblazer Accounts in Salesforce Help.\n\nHelp with Trailblazer Accounts\n\nFor issues with Salesforce Certifications appearing on your Trailblazer profile, first check whether your Webassessor and Trailhead linking status is correct. Visit the Certification Verification Page and enter your Webassessor email address in the Certification Holders: Check Your Status box. You receive an email that tells you which Trailblazer profile is linked to your Certification Webassessor account. For more help, view the Trailhead Help article Link Your Trailhead and Webassessor Accounts or submit a Trailhead Help case.\n\nIf your Trailhead badge totals or point values on your Trailblazer profile look incorrect, or your profile was merged with a colleague's profile, submit a Trailhead Help case.\n\nTrailblazer Accounts\nA Trailblazer account is a single identity that you use to log in to and interact with multiple Salesforce-related sites.\nSign Up for a Trailblazer Account\nTo access Salesforce digital properties with a single login, sign up for a Trailblazer account.\nTrailblazer Single-Use Codes\nA Trailblazer account provides the ability to sign up and log in using an email address, without creating a password. Trailblazer verifies your identity by using a single-use code.\nTrailblazer Recovery Accounts\nConnect your Trailblazer account to another email account or social login as a recovery account.\nTrailblazer Account Merges\nSome actions trigger a Trailblazer account merge, combining activity from multiple accounts into one. You can choose to manually merge two or more accounts.\nYour Trailblazer Profile\nYour Trailblazer profile contains information from different Salesforce-related sites so you have an at-a-glance view of your skills and activity.\nConsiderations for Deleting Your Trailblazer Account\nBefore deleting your Trailblazer account, make sure that you’re aware of what happens to your profile and history.\nGet Help with Trailblazer\nYour Trailblazer account is your single identity for multiple Salesforce-related sites.
