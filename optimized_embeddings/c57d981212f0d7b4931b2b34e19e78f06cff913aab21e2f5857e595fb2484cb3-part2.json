Contributors are users or public groups in your org that you add to your CMS workspace. Contributors can belong to more than one workspace and have specific roles in each workspace, according to the level of access they need.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nContent admin\nThese contributors have access to all content in the CMS workspace and can manage contributors and content sharing.\nNOTE If you used CMS for Experience Cloud previously, as part of your migration to Salesforce CMS, we automatically assign a content admin role to existing Digital Experiences users with Create and Setup Experiences permissions.\nContent manager\nThese contributors have full access to all content in the CMS workspace.\nContent author\nThese contributors can create, edit, and view content in the CMS workspace. They can’t publish content.\n\nA contributor can have a content admin or a content manager role. Content admins have access to all content in the CMS workspace, and they can manage workspace languages, workspace contributors, content translations, and content sharing. Content managers have access to all content in the CMS workspace, including creating content, publishing content, and marking content for translation. Your Salesforce admin can control who has access to what in all of the Digital Experiences app (previously named Salesforce CMS) and your Experience Cloud sites.\n\nEXAMPLE AWZ Computing has four Experience Cloud sites: two internal and two external for two different regions. Their Salesforce admin wants to provide authoring and sharing ability by region and by campaign. They create three workspaces: one for their two external sites, which use the same content, one for their internal sites, and a temporary one for a targeted campaign.\n\nThey add an admin to each workspace, besides themselves, to help manage the workspace, and they add content managers who author content. Because of the potentially sensitive nature of the content, only the Human Resources group needs access to administer and contribute to the workspace for the internal communications. Content admins can administer a workspace and create content for it, so they make the HR group the only content admins for the Internal Communications workspace other than themselves.\n\nLater, HR contacts the Salesforce admin to explain that they’re working on an incentive program tied to their fall campaign. To reach the eligible people with the information, they want to add content and information to the Fall US Campaign workspace. Because contributors can have different roles in different workspaces, the Salesforce admin makes the HR group content managers in the Fall US Campaign workspace. This role provides them authoring rights, but not full control of the workspace.\n\nThe Salesforce admin created a matrix they can update as business needs change.\n\nCMS WORKSPACE NAME\tCHANNELS\t\n\nCONTRIBUTORS\n\n(USERS AND PUBLIC GROUPS)\n\n\nExternal Sites\t\n\nNorth America\n\nEurope\n\n\t\n\nSalesforce admin\n\nSite admin as content admin\n\nMarketing writer as content manager\n\n\nFall US Campaign\t\n\nNorth America\n\nCompany intranet\n\n\t\n\nSalesforce admin\n\nSite admin as content admin\n\nMarketing writer as content manager\n\nHR as content manager\n\n\nInternal Communications\t\n\nCompany intranet US\n\nCompany intranet EMEA\n\n\t\n\nSalesforce admin\n\nHR as content admin\n\nAdd Contributors to a CMS Workspace\nIn the Digital Experiences app (previously named Salesforce CMS), add users or public groups as contributors to a specific CMS workspace by assigning them an access role. A contributor’s access role is specific to a CMS workspace.\nChange a Contributor’s Access Role\nYou can change a contributor’s access role to increase or decrease the level of access. A contributor’s access role is specific to a CMS workspace, so you must change the contributor’s role in each assigned workspace. Admins can’t change their own role.\nRemove a Contributor from a CMS Workspace\nIf a contributor leaves your company or is transferred to a different team, you can remove the contributor from a CMS workspace. The user or public group is removed from the workspace but not from Salesforce.\nSEE ALSO\nRole-Based Access in Experience Builder\nControl Chatter Access Through Permission Sets\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
