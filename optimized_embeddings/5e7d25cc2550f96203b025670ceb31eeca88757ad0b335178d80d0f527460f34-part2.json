Examples include datasets from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the International Energy Agency (IEA), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nEvaluate your value chain emissions from suppliers and consumers, and convert spending data into emissions estimates. Measure scope 3 emissions from suppliers and consumers in the value chain, and identify suppliers that have a high impact on total emissions.\nBuild and view your carbon footprints, spanning scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and extract key insights that drive your climate-conscious decisions.\nPerform carbon accounting across complex organizational structures, such as subsidiaries of the parent company or joint venture. The parent company can consolidate the greenhouse gas emissions within its organizational structure, for effective greenhouse gas management and reporting.\nAllow your parent company to apportion emissions more accurately in the parent inventory by allocating a percentage of emissions from their partially-owned subsidiaries or partners in their company hierarchy to the parent company.\nWaste and Water Management\nIncorporate waste management data to estimate emissions from waste generated during operations and from product end-of-life disposal.\nCreate the water usage data of stationary assets and the water usage data of your suppliers, to calculate water footprints.\nClimate Action Dashboards\nEvaluate corporate environmental impact with data visualizations and prebuilt CRM Analytics dashboards.\nUse the dashboards in the Net Zero Analytics app to analyze your scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions data and take measures to reduce your carbon footprint. The Net Zero Cloud Analytics dashboards are available only for Salesforce Net Zero Cloud users with CRM Analytics for Net Zero Cloud add-on license.\nGet predictions about your company’s carbon emissions from air travel. Reduce your company's carbon emissions by analyzing air travel emission patterns and reviewing rule-based recommendations to decrease the emissions.\nDecrease your company’s carbon footprint by predicting the carbon emissions and fuel consumption of your stationary assets for a specific year. Show predicted data in the stationary asset environmental source record pages by embedding dashboards.\nReduce your company's carbon emissions by analyzing the predictions of the supply chain emissions.\nAnalyze and compare the energy intensity of your office buildings with similar buildings using Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data and emissions from each office.\nWhat-If Analysis and Emissions Forecasting\nCreate climate action commitments and set science-based targets that align with your sustainability goals.\nTrack supplier sustainability commitments and emissions using scorecards to easily identify suppliers that don’t yet have a science-based target.\nEstimate future emissions by activity type and compare the forecasted values against your targets.\nExperiment with different scenarios to visualize how planned or potential sustainability measures affect your emissions forecast. Monitor your progress towards net zero using Emission Forecasts and What-If Analysis dashboard.\nCarbon Credit Allocation\nAllocate and manage your carbon credits with a consolidated view of your purchase history, scope-wise allocations, and utilization.\nSocial and Governance Reporting\nEnter, extract, and report quantitative disclosures in social and governance reports.\nGenerate consolidated social and governance data reports for extended organizational boundaries, such as subsidiaries of the parent company or external partners within a single organization.\nDisclosure and Compliance Hub for ESG Reporting\nGenerate disclosures by gathering qualitative and quantitative responses to questionnaires by using the Disclosure and Compliance Hub. You can create formatted disclosures using a guided process to extract data from Salesforce objects and other data sources.

You can include the disclosures report in your GRI, CDP, SASB, or ESRS report.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Dashboard\nAnalyze and visualize workforce data to detect diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) gaps, identify trends, and spot opportunities to improve DEI policies by using DEI Analytics.\nCollaboration Through Data Upload\nDownload and use CSV templates to upload data obtained through collaboration for carbon accounting, waste footprints, water management, or social and governance objects into Net Zero Cloud. The CSV template file is formatted for the selected object, in which you can. add the data and upload it to Received Documents for processing.\nGet Started with Net Zero Cloud\nLearn how Net Zero Cloud can help your company achieve net zero by supporting prioritization of emission reductions. Use Net Zero Cloud to align your company’s full value chain (scopes 1, 2, and 3) to the global trajectory of ~50% emissions reduction by 2030, and near-zero emissions by 2040. Net Zero Cloud also helps your company compensate for remaining emissions by purchasing renewable energy and carbon credits of high credibility. Explore the trial org to learn about what’s included, the recommended setup, and how to get ready for your implementation.\nCreate a Net Zero Cloud Trial Org\nExperience hands-on engagement with Net Zero Cloud in a full-featured trial. Trial orgs are intended for proof of concept and guided self-exploration. Trial orgs expire in 30 days.\nDeveloper Resources for Net Zero Cloud\nLearn where to find developer resources, including the entity relationship diagram (ERD), object reference, and apex reference.\nSustainability Cloud Legacy Documentation\nLearn about the available documentation for the managed package version of Sustainability Cloud.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
