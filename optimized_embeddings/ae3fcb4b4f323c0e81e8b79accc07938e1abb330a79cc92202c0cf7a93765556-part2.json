For example, a sales rep records themselves practicing their pitch, uploads the recording to a video platform, and then invites experienced sales leaders to give feedback. Feedback Request exercises for peer and manager feedback use assessment surveys, which include rating and short text questions for the reviewers to complete. After the reviewers provide their feedback, Enablement users can view the feedback in the Guidance Center. Enablement admins can use feedback response analytics to gain insight about users’ behavioral changes as they progress through a program.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nFull Enablement is available with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nEnablement Lite is available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\nIMPORTANT Feedback Request exercises aren’t supported in Partner Enablement programs in Experience Cloud sites.\nGuidelines for Assessment Surveys with Feedback Request Exercises\nReview the permissions required to work with Peer and Manager Feedback Request exercises. Learn guidelines for creating assessment surveys, sending feedback requests, and providing survey responses.\nSet Up Surveys and Permissions for Feedback Request Exercises\nTo let Enablement admins add assessment surveys to Feedback Request exercises in their Enablement programs, Salesforce admins must enable surveys and assign the appropriate permissions.\nEvaluate or Copy the Default Assessment Survey\nThe full Enablement add-on license includes a default assessment survey, Discovery Call Assessment, which provides questions for reviewers to evaluate a sales rep on their practice sales pitch. You can use this default assessment survey, or copy it as a starting point for a custom assessment survey.\nShare Assessment Surveys with Enablement Admins\nTo ensure that Enablement admins can access assessment surveys when they assemble sales programs for users in Lightning Experience, share the surveys with them. Share surveys manually with specific Enablement admins, or share surveys automatically with all Enablement admins at your company by creating a public group and corresponding sharing rule.\nAdd a Feedback Request Exercise with an Assessment Survey for Peers and Managers\nEnablement admins add the Feedback Request exercise to a program and specify the assessment survey that reviewers complete and the number of reviewers that an Enablement user must select. After the program is published and made available, users submit their content for review and select the required number of reviewers.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
