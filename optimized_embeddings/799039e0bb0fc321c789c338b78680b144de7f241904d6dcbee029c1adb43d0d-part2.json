The Government Cloud operating zone meets stringent government standards. Its tailored compliance protocols, robust security measures, and integration capabilities ensure data integrity, privacy, and adherence to compliance requirements.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Unlimited and Enterprise Editions\n\nDesigned exclusively for government agencies, Government Cloud enables agencies to customize Salesforce products and services to securely manage their day-to-day operations. Customize your Salesforce experience by picking the products and features your agency wants to use. Government Cloud runs on dedicated servers that are designed to accommodate government data and comply with a wide array of security, privacy, and risk management requirements. Salesforce delivers this experience in an environment dedicated to government users and contractors.\n\nIn the United States, the authorization process begins with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF). The RMF is a process that identifies and minimizes supply-chain risks and ensures security and privacy in information systems and technology. Government agencies build on this process to identify specific compliance requirements. A compliance baseline is a minimum security requirement for government entities, such as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP®) High or the Department of Defense (DoD) Impact Level (IL) 5.\n\nEvery government agency has unique requirements for digital tools and workflows. For that reason, you can customize your Government Cloud installation to create a solution that addresses your specific needs. Government Cloud products are available to all United States local, state, federal, and tribal agencies or companies who are required to meet United States government security and compliance requirements.\n\nGovernment Cloud Offerings\n\nGovernment Cloud Plus and Government Cloud Plus - Defense environments are secure instances of Customer 360. Both products comply with United States-mandated security and compliance regulations. Government Cloud Plus provides a FedRAMP High and DoD IL4 authorized government cloud platform. Government Cloud Plus - Defense uses a physically dedicated and isolated infrastructure for the DoD that includes security enhancements for handling DoD IL5 data.\n\nA FedRAMP-approved third-party organization (3PAO) conducts annual security assessments of Government Cloud. These assessments adhere to NIST Special Publication 800-53A, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal and Information Systems and Organizations, as well as FedRAMP and DoD requirements. Security assessment testing determines the adequacy of the security controls that Salesforce uses to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Government Cloud Plus and Government Cloud Plus - Defense. This testing includes assessing the security of the customer data that Salesforce stores, transmits, and processes.\n\nProducts available in Government Cloud Plus and Hyperforce\n\nGovernment Cloud Authorization Boundary\n\nDesigned for mission impact customers, Government Cloud Plus and Government Cloud Plus - Defense environments are secure instances of Customer 360. Government Cloud and Government Cloud Plus - Defense include industry-leading solutions designed with FedRAMP compliance in mind.\n\nGovernment Cloud defines an authorization boundary as an architectural element. An authorized boundary is a logical barrier of all components and services within an operating zone. An authorized boundary outlines the scope of Government Cloud, specifying its interactions with external systems and services beyond the boundary.\n\nGet Started with Government Cloud\nGovernment Cloud transforms the delivery of government services by using flexible tools to handle secure data and workloads. Salesforce follows strict compliance requirements to implement dedicated environments that meet government customers’ compliance obligations. Products in Government Cloud environments are authorized against one or more public sector compliance baselines. Government agencies can tailor their compliance baseline to meet their needs. Salesforce has created a baseline that’s inclusive of all frameworks and controls we support.\nWhat’s Included in Government Cloud\nLearn what’s available for agencies using Government Cloud.
