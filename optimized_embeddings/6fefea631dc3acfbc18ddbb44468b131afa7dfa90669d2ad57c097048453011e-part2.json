The campaign record is a hub for your marketing effort, while the campaign flow automates content distribution and data collection. For more robust campaigns, add additional flows from the campaign record. Each flow inherits its name from the campaign.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition, and in Starter and Pro Suite Editions. Your edition determines the options that you have.\n\nThe campaign and flow functionality in Marketing Cloud Growth is also available in Salesforce Starter and Pro Suite. For more information, see Salesforce Starter and Pro Suite Help.\n\nWhat Is a Campaign?\n\nIn Salesforce, a campaign is an object that functions like a hub or folder. A campaign is connected to the assets and related metadata that comprise and track a marketing effort. Campaigns make it possible to report on your performance.\n\nIn Marketing Cloud Growth, you can choose from preconfigured campaigns to help you get started, such as an email series or signup form. Each campaign’s layout is designed to give easier access to the related data and content, and looks different from campaign records in other Salesforce apps. These campaigns are powered by at least one underlying flow.\n\nWhat Is a Flow?\n\nSalesforce admins usually use a flow to automate a complex task for users. A marketer can configure a flow with a series of steps that do different things, such as managing users, and routing records through specific processes. You can configure a flow in Flow Builder. In Marketing Cloud Growth, flows automate tasks such as content distribution and lead creation.\n\nA flow is represented as a flowchart: a collection of boxes and connecting lines that lay out a series of ordered steps. When a flow runs, it completes each step in the order shown.\n\nHow Are Flows Used in Marketing Cloud Growth?\n\nA flow is related to your campaigns and focus on marketing tasks. You can use a flow to send or publish content, collect data, create records in Salesforce, and more. Campaign flows come configured with one or more elements to help you get started.\n\nAlthough every Marketing Cloud Growth user has access to campaigns by default, a flow requires other permissions that are included in the Marketing Manager permission set.\n\nHow Do I Work with a Campaign Flow?\n\nWhen you create a campaign, a related flow is automatically created and given the same name as your campaign record. You can add flows to your campaign from the campaign record. Access a flow from a campaign record, from the Flows page, or from the Flows Lightning app.\n\nWhen you add a segment, a form, or scheduling details on a campaign record, they appear in the flow’s Start node. If the campaign flow doesn’t meet your needs, you can add, move, and remove elements on the Flow Builder canvas.\n\nHow Are Campaigns and Flows Related?\n\nWhen a flow is related to a campaign, they share important information. Keep these considerations in mind before you change their relationship or delete one of them.\n\nWhen a flow is active, you can't remove its campaign or relate it to a different campaign.\nA flow can have only one active version. Even if the flow is paused, it’s considered the active version. If you change a paused or resumed active flow, you must save it as a new version.\nEach campaign flow has its own record that’s related to a campaign record. To change the campaign that a flow is related to, you can edit the Associated Record field on the flow record. You can also relate multiple flows to a campaign record, but you can’t relate multiple campaigns to the same flow.\nWhen you delete a campaign, its related flows remain in their current state, and those flows' sharing settings revert to the defined sharing rules for that flow. If no sharing rules are defined, the flow’s sharing settings revert to private and accessible only to the owner, Salesforce admins, and anyone with View All Non-Setup Flows or Manage Flow permissions.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
