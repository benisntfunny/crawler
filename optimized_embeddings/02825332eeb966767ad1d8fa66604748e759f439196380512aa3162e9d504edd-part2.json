For example, the payment was submitted with a misspelling in the credit card address or an incorrect CVV.\n\nStatus\t\n\nIndicates the status of the payment transaction.\n\nPossible values are:\n\nCanceled—The payment has been voided and can no longer be allocated\nDraft—The payment can be edited before posting it and allocating it to a target.\nFailed—The authorization for the payment failed.\nProcessed—The payment has been finalized and can be allocated against a target.\n\nTotal Applied\tThe total amount of the payment that has been applied against an invoice.\nTotal Refund Applied\tThe total amount of the refund that has been applied against the payment.\nTotal Refund Unapplied\tThe total amount of a previously applied refund that has been unapplied from the payment.\nTotal Unapplied\tThe total amount of the payment that was previously applied against an invoice that has been unapplied.\nType\t\n\nIndicates how the customer used this payment.\n\nPossible values are:\n\nCapture\nSale\nSEE ALSO\nOrder Management Objects and Fields\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
