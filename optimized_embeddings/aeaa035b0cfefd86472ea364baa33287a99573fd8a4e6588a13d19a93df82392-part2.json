Select Edit Page to open the Lightning App Builder.\nGo to the Appointments tab.\nFrom the menu of components, drag the Appointments Related List component to the Appointments tab in the page canvas.\nIn the component's Properties pane:\nSet the Status to Upcoming, Past, or Cancelled.\nIf desired, change the value of the Show New Button field to show or hide the New button in the related list.\nRepeat Steps 4 and 5 to add the other two Appointments related lists.\nSave your changes and exit Lightning App Builder.\nConfigure the Tasks Related Lists\n\nYou can give support staff the option to create tasks from the Tasks related lists in a Student Record Case.

If you display the Activity related list in the app, make sure you review with your support staff members these details about using it.\n\nThe Activity related list lets support staff manage all the Tasks related to a student, including Tasks assigned to the student and Tasks assigned to other people, such as someone on the student's success team. In contrast, the Tasks related list shows only the Tasks assigned to the student. If you don't display the Activity related list, support staff are limited to viewing Tasks assigned to the student in the Tasks related list.\nAppointment data is shown on the Appointments tab in the Upcoming Appointments and Past Appointments related lists. The Activity related list does not show Appointments. If your school tracks any Events that are related to the Student Record Case (that is, Events other than Appointments), and it's useful for support staff to see those Events, then it can be useful to display the Activity related list.\n\nDo not use the New Event button on the Activity related list to create Appointments.\n\nAdd the Task Mass Action Button to Cases List Views\n\nGive support staff the option to create a task for one or more students from Cases list views.\n\nNOTE Keep in mind that any mass actions you add to Cases list views are visible by all users.\n\nAdd the custom task button to Cases list views.\n\nFrom Setup, in Object Manager, click Case.\nOn the Search Layouts for Salesforce Classic page, click the action menu for the List View row and select Edit.\nAdd the Create Student Task custom buttons to the Selected Buttons list.\nSave your changes.\n\nGive support staff access to the page that opens when they click the Create Student Task button.\n\nFrom Setup, search for then select Profiles.\nClick the support staff profile.\nIn the Visualforce Page Access section, verify that the CreateTaskMassAction item is in the Enabled Visualforce Pages list.\nSave your changes\n\nVerify that the button appears in the app and works as expected.\n\nLog in to the Student Success Hub app as a support staff member and click Cases.\nSelect a Cases list view, such as My Students.\n\nConfirm that the Create Student Task button appears at the top of the page.\n\nTest the button by selecting the checkbox next to one or more students, and then clicking Create Student Task.\n\nNOTE The selected Cases must be Student Record Cases and their associated Contacts must also have an associated Customer Community Plus or Customer Community Plus Login user.\nEnter task details and save your changes.\nVerify that the selected students are assigned the task.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
