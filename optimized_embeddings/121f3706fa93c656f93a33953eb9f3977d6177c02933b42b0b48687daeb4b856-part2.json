Before diving in, though, take some time to understand your existing authentication systems and to identify your requirements for an MFA solution. By starting with an evaluation period, you can collect the data needed to align with your leadership and develop a project plan.\n\nReview the Authentication Solutions Currently in Place for Salesforce\nBefore you start planning a multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, understand the authentication methods that you’re currently using for your Salesforce products. Consider aligning or integrating MFA with other authentication solutions that you’re already using, such as single sign-on (SSO).\nPreview Multi-Factor Authentication\nAs part of your evaluation process, it’s useful to see how multi-factor authentication (MFA) works and what the user experience is. Get a preview by turning on MFA for a few of your Salesforce champions and then collect their feedback. This input helps you anticipate how the rest of your users feel about using MFA, and whether to head off resistance with marketing and education. Your champions can also provide feedback on the types of training and onboarding support to help users be successful when you roll out MFA more broadly. And another benefit is you learn exactly what it takes to implement MFA, which helps inform your rollout and implementation plans.\nDetermine Business and User Requirements for MFA\nTo define the multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation that works best for your company, determine your business requirements. And understand what your users need for a positive, productive experience. These criteria make it clear which MFA verification methods you must support in your implementation.\nConduct a User Inventory for Your MFA Implementation\nGet a sense of the level of effort for your multi-factor authentication (MFA) project by doing an inventory of all Salesforce users. Identify the types of users and roles that exist, such as business users, admins, contractors, partners, and non-human accounts. And catalog the permissions that are assigned to each user.\nAssess Org and User Readiness for MFA\nIdentify if there are any dependencies, prerequisites, or blockers that you must address before enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA). Address these issues ahead of time, or plan to resolve them during the implementation stage of your MFA project.\nMake the Case for MFA\nWhen you’re finished evaluating options and requirements for your multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation, share the findings with your leadership and affected stakeholders. Make the case for MFA by addressing the risks of the current threat landscape. And explain the benefits and ROI that your company and your customers get by adding another layer of protection for Salesforce logins. You need this group’s support to green light an MFA project and allocate resources for the work.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
