If you use an unsupported browser, you get a degraded experience. For best performance, we recommend that console users adopt the Google Chrome™ browser and machines with 8 GB of RAM. Keep in mind that 32-bit systems are subject to memory limitations. To take full advantage of the added RAM, use 64-bit versions of both the operating system and the browser.\nWhen using Chat in the Salesforce Classic Console, we recommend using Internet Explorer 8, 9, or 10 or the latest stable version of Firefox or Google Chrome.\nA console offers limited support for right-to-left languages, such as Arabic or Hebrew. Since right-to-left languages aren’t fully supported, some features don’t appear as expected in a console, such as Case Feed, Chat, and Salesforce Knowledge.\nAll Salesforce CRM Content items display as primary tabs in a console.\nWhen using Social Accounts, Contacts, and Leads, the Social Viewer window doesn’t align properly within a console.\nRecord home pages, including their standard Tools sections, don’t display in a console.\nBehavior and Access Limitations\nBack buttons on browsers are not supported for a console and don’t work as expected.\nA Salesforce console doesn’t meet accessibility requirements.\nVisualforce pages don’t refresh when you click  and select Refresh all primary tabs or Refresh all subtabs. In addition, if you override a detail page with a Visualforce page that uses related lists, any new records created using that related list aren't displayed until the page is reopened in a new tab.\nIf you edit a page layout in the console, such as adding a primary tab component like an interaction log, the updated layout isn’t displayed until the page is closed and then reopened in a new primary tab.\nYou can't directly edit the fields on the highlights panel; however, when you change those fields on a record, the highlights panel is automatically updated.\nSome objects haven’t been fully adapted to a console, such as reports, dashboards, and Chatter. These and other objects are marked with an asterisk (*) in the console setup area and can cause unexpected behaviors. For example: (1) When viewing opportunity splits, clicking Cancel doesn’t close the subtab; instead, the page detail information is opened in a subtab; (2) opportunity line items and quote line items don’t automatically refresh when changed—you need to refresh the page to see the latest changes.\nIf you leave a console and return to it, any subtabs that were displayed don’t automatically reload. Also, if you leave a console by selecting an app from the Lightning Platform app menu, your browser's Back and Forward buttons don’t work as expected.\nIf you save changes in a lookup component, and you have unsaved changes in another lookup component, the unsaved changes are lost without a warning message.\nIf you click a custom link or a link in a text field, such as https://salesforce.com/ in a case Description, the link appears in a window instead of a tab.\nIf you refresh the Change Case Status page in a console, an Unable to Access Page error appears.\nIf Chatter is disabled, you can’t use pinning in search results.\nIf you log in to another Salesforce app while you’re logged in to a Salesforce Classic Console app, you can’t accept new chat requests.\nCustomization Limitations\n\nTo edit a Salesforce Classic console app, you must be in Salesforce Classic. From Setup, enter Apps in the Quick Find box, then select Apps and click Edit next to your console app.\n\nYou can’t upgrade a Salesforce Classic console app to Lightning Experience. You can choose to display or hide the app in the Lightning Experience App Launcher, but you can’t edit the app from the App Manager page in Lightning Experience Setup. To get started in Lightning Experience, customize these Salesforce-provided Lightning console apps: Service Console and Sales Console. You can also recreate your Salesforce Classic console app in Lightning Experience, but using Salesforce’s out-of-the-box app is faster and easier.\n\nThe console doesn’t support Chatter Messenger.\nSome Visualforce pages don’t display correctly in a console unless they're updated to show in it.\nThe console doesn’t support Visualforce pages that use the Require CSRF protection on GET requests preference. If you use Visualforce pages with CSRF protection, your agents can receive errors when trying to access the page.\nCall center users can only use a softphone in a Salesforce console if they're using a CTI adapter built with Open CTI.\nChat is only available for a console with the Service Cloud.\nThe highlights panel for Chat Transcripts is editable, but you can’t turn it on for users.\nYou can’t add a console to customer portals or partner portals.\nIn Chatter Answers, administrators can’t customize the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) available to customers when they click Need help?.\nJoined reports aren't supported in console apps.\nExternal Object Limitations\nExternal objects are available in the Salesforce Console in Salesforce Classic only. Other consoles aren’t supported.\nExternal objects haven’t been fully adapted to a console and can cause unexpected behaviors. Other objects also haven’t been fully adapted to a console, but those objects are marked with an asterisk (*) in the console setup area. External objects aren’t marked with asterisks.\nThe external objects’ associated external data sources must have the High Data Volume option deselected. This requirement doesn’t apply to the cross-org adapter for Salesforce Connect.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Console in Salesforce Classic\nPlan Your Salesforce Console Implementation\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
