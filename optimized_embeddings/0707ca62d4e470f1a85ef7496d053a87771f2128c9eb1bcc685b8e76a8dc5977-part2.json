You must externally merge any changes in the source control repository before you can perform the deployment using the CLI. While the CLI command runs, you can see the progress of the promotion reflected in the DevOps Center Pipeline Stages tab.\n\nNOTE This feature is a Beta Service. Customer may opt to try such Beta Service in its sole discretion. Any use of the Beta Service is subject to the applicable Beta Services Terms provided at Agreements and Terms.\n\nThe DevOps Center CLI plugin is compatible with DevOps Center package version 6.0 or later. The DevOps Center plugin (plugin-devops-center) is installed the first time you run a CLI command. To install and configure the CLI, see the Salesforce CLI Setup Guide.\n\nSalesforce CLI releases on a weekly basis. See the Salesforce CLI Release Notes for information on the timing for the official release of the DevOps Center plugin.\n\nThe CLI commands for DevOps Center include:\n\nproject deploy pipeline start\nDeploy changes from a branch to the pipeline stage’s org.\nproject deploy pipeline report\nCheck the status of a pipeline deployment operation.\nproject deploy pipeline resume\nResume watching a pipeline deployment operation.\nproject deploy pipeline validate\nPerform a validate-only deployment from a branch to the pipeline stage’s org. You can create a validation for only the bundling stage and versioned stages.\nproject deploy pipeline quick\nQuickly deploy a validated deployment to an org.\n\nTo see all command options, you can view help directly in a terminal or command window. Append --help to the command name. In this example, all project deploy pipeline commands are listed:\n\nsf project deploy pipeline --help\n\nTo view condensed help for a command, use the -h flag. For detailed information on all CLI commands, see the Salesforce CLI Command Reference.\n\nTo use the DevOps Center CLI commands, you must:\n\nBe assigned the DevOps Center Release Manager permission set. This permission set enables you to perform promotions. Ask a Salesforce admin or project manager for assistance.\nAuthorize the org in which DevOps Center is installed. The easiest way to authorize an org is with the org login web command. See Authorization in the Salesforce DX Developer Guide for details.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate how to deploy changes to a pipeline stage’s environment using Salesforce CLI. First, changes must be merged to a pipeline stage branch directly in the source control repository. When the pipeline deploy command is run, all externally merged changes are deployed to the corresponding pipeline stage environment.\n\nTIP To avoid having to indicate the --devops-center-username each time you run a DevOps Center CLI command, you can set it using a configuration variable. See target-devops-center in the Salesforce CLI Setup Guide: Configuration Variables for details.\n\nIn these examples, line breaks are added for readability purposes.\n\nIn this first example, several work item feature branches were merged to the Integration branch. To deploy the changes from the Integration branch to the Integration environment:\n\nsf project deploy pipeline start --branch-name recruit-integration \n--devops-center-username MyDevOpsCenterOrg --devops-center-project-name \"Recruiting App\"\n\nIn this example, UAT is the bundling stage, which means that you indicate a version identifier. To deploy all merged changes in a version 1.0 bundle to the UAT environment:\n\nsf project deploy pipeline start --branch-name recruit-uat --devops-center-username \nMyDevOpsCenterOrg --devops-center-project-name \"Recruiting App\" --bundle-version-name 1.0\n\nIn this example, you’re ready to validate the changes in the Staging branch so you can perform a quick deployment to production. When ready, you can perform the quick deployment in DevOps Center Pipeline Stages. To run a validate-only deployment:\n\nsf project deploy pipeline validate --branch-name recruit-staging --devops-center-username \nMyDevOpsCenterOrg --test-level RunLocalTests --devops-center-project-name \"Recruiting App\"\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce CLI Command Reference: sf project deploy pipeline\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
