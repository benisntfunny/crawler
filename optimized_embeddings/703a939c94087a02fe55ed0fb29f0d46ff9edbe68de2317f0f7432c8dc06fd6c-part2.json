It's a simple concept—but a powerful process.\n\nTIP\n\nHere’s a couple of bite-sized tidbits about quotes that will come in handy as you move forward:\n\nQuotes can be generated only from within an existing opportunity or account;\n\nOpportunities and accounts can have multiple associated quotes;\n\nYou can view and sort your quotes from the App Launcher > Quotes page.\n\nUser Input\n\nThe first part of the OmniScript configuration in the quote flow process is user input. This is the part of the process where you gather up top-level information for the quote.\n\nThe first part of the OmniScript structure, Script Configuration, is where you get the whole quote ball rolling. This is a good spot to enter an account ID, or an opportunity ID, or some kind of Salesforce Record ID which identifies that piece of information for the OmniScript. \n\nNotice the label Seed Data JSON in the Properties panel of the OmniScript, in the image below. That’s where you enter the key/value pairs of the Records for the quote. So any IDs you have, this is where they go, right at the top of your Script Configuration.\n\nTIP\n\nThe user input part of OmniScript configuration also includes more specific input fields, which further refine the quote. Further on in the OmniScript configuration, Integration Procedures and Omnistudio Data Mappers will take all this input data and generate inputIds and JSONs that are used in the ratings calculation and the quote.\n\nOdds are high if you’re creating a health insurance quote for a small group, you’ve got a spreadsheet filled with employee data. So you’ll want to seed the JSON with this data using the censusId, which points to a census within Vlocity. There’s also a quoteId value in there too, which is used for renewals of existing quotes. \n\nGenerally speaking, data seeding is a way to get the quote process rolling with customer information. The Seed Data JSON property in the OmniScript Configuration section can be used to either pre-fill OmniScript fields with data or add hidden nodes to the OmniScript Data JSON.\n\nTo make a long story short: data input is the first part of the quote flow process which seed and define the Data JSON that is used in the quoting process.\n\nNow, it’s time to add and rate your products. But first, maybe a little background on the OmniScript Data JSON.\n\nThe Data JSON\n\nThe OmniScript Data JSON is just that: the JSON associated with a particular OmniScript. It has all the JSONs associated with the OmniScript. JSON inputs and outputs are used in many ways behind the scenes, by many services, in an OmniScript quote flow, as part of the Data JSON. Understand this, and you’re well on your way to success. \n\nTIP\n\nThe Vlocity runtime DOM keeps track of the Data JSON as you're moving through the OS. You can always see the full Data JSON when you're in Preview mode and then clicking {Data} to toggle the view.\n\nProducts and Rates\n\nProducts configured with attributes and rules get pulled into the OmniScript with the two services that are central to the quoting process: getRatedProducts and getRatedGroupProducts. Both of these services are part of the InsProductService class.\n\nHere’s how they each work: \n\ngetRatedProducts passes the JSON input that the rating procedure needs to price products. It returns a filtered array of products, along with the resultant JSON from the rating procedure.\n\ngetRatedGroupProducts is used only with group products that use a census. It works in conjunction with getRatedProducts to rate products. In fact, it uses all the same remote options as getRatedProducts does. \n\nIn a nutshell: these services find the products—car insurance, vision plans, etc.—and then rates them. It’s an understatement to say that getRatedProducts is a powerhouse of a service in the quote flow process. If you’re an OmniScript developer, you're going to want to know this one inside and out.\n\nNOTE\n\nTechnically speaking, services are methods of Apex classes that reduce or eliminate the need for custom programming. They encapsulate functionality you require for your business application. \n\nApex is like Java for Salesforce. It’s an object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on the Lightning Platform server, in conjunction with calls to the API.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of the various insurance and health insurance services currently in play as of this writing, with the quoting ones highlighted. We’re continually creating new services, so check the services directory for the latest and greatest.\n\nIf you’re an OmniScript developer, you will live and die by Vlocity services. If you’re working more from the front-end business side of things, all you need to know is that a bunch of dedicated Vlocity developers put together a series of logical statements within curly-bracketed thingamabobs to make your life a whole lot easier.\n\nCreate Quote\n\nThe createUpdateQuote service takes all your data seeding and other inputs, mashes it all up with the product ratings you called out, and provides a dollar figure output for plans and products. \n\nAs its name suggests, the createUpdateQuote service is going to do all the heavy lifting here. The create part of the service name is for new quotes. The word update refers to the updating of existing quotes (which comes in handy for things like open enrollment in the  health insurance world).  \n\nAs far as services go, it’s central to the actual quote generation. The information this service requires includes:\n\nopportunityID\n\naccountID\n\neffectiveDate\n\nproductConfigurationDetail records\n\ninstanceKey\n\ninsuredItems \n\nThe insuredItems option is a particularly needy option. It expects a list of insured item specs and insured party specs in the JSON, using each spec's productCode as a key. \n\nThere’s another service that comes into play here too, getQuoteDetails. This is the final step of the journey, where an output JSON is returned which contains nodes for insured parties and insured items; quote details field set; and product configuration details.\n\nLearn About the Quoting Flow\n\nFor a quick introduction to quoting in Vlocity Health, check out the Insurance Quoting Foundations module available on the Digital Insurance Developer and Digital Insurance Consultant customer learning journeys.\n\nVlocity Health Direct to Customer Quoting\nEmpower guest users and customers to create their own quotes whenever they want with Direct to Customer Quoting. Give your independent customers (and potential customers) the freedom to explore options on their own, and free up your agents and CSRs to help even more customers.\nSmall Group Health Quotes\nSmall group health quoting is a process to market and sell health insurance to small group employers (usually a business with two to 50 full-time employees). Quotes are generated based on a customer’s preferences and premium costs calculated from variables like number of employees, dependents, geography, required coverages, and employer contributions. The quotes are presented to the employer for acceptance.\nSmall Group New Quotes and Renewals\nCreate a comprehensive quote-to-contract workflow for Small Group quotes. You can use Omniscripts to display multiple Small Group rated health plans. Templates for new quotes and renewals are provided.\nLarge Group Quoting Overview\nYou can use the large group quote UI to build quotes for health insurance plans and voluntary benefits plans. In order to do large group quoting, you must configure the Quote UI to include the components and options you'll need to create these quotes:\n/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=ind.v_health_census_quote_management_481480.htm\n\nEmployer Contributions\nThe Group Class Contribution object is used to identify a group of members that will all receive similar benefits when different classes of members receive different benefits (such as executives, union, office workers, and so forth).\nUsing Price Books\nPrice books provide the flexibility to create a custom collection of products with associated list prices for specific uses.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
