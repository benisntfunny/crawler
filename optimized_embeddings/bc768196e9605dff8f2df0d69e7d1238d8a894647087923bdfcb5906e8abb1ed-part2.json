Search result relevance can vary for each user. Search returns only the records that you have access to view.\n\nOn the search results page, your most relevant records appear first. The order of results depends on several factors, such as:\n\nHow often your search term appears in a record\nWhether there's an exact match\nHow unique your search term is\nHow much you've interacted with the record\nHow Records are Ranked\n\nThe search engine uses many factors to prioritize records. These factors aren't listed in the order they’re applied or by importance.\n\nRANKED BY:\tWHY?\n\n\nFrequency\n\n\t\n\nPrioritizes records that include more occurrences of the search term. In addition, records that contain all or more of the multiple search terms entered are prioritized higher.\n\n\n\n\nUniqueness\n\n\t\n\nPrioritizes records that contain unique terms, under the assumption that uniqueness increases the likelihood of a relevant match.\n\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\tPrioritizes records with the search term in the name, title, or subject type fields.\n\n\nProximity\n\n\t\n\nPrioritizes records with the search terms closer together with few or no intervening words. Records that contain the same sequence of terms are prioritized higher. Similarly, if a single alphanumeric string is indexed with multiple tokens, exact matches are prioritized over matches with intervening words.\n\n\n\n\nOwnership\n\n\t\n\nPrioritizes records that you own.\n\n\n\n\nLength\n\n\t\n\nNormalizes the number of instances of a term in a record so that longer documents aren't given undue priority over shorter ones. This boost applies to Salesforce Knowledge records only.\n\nNormalizes the number of instances of a term in an attachment. Attachments with many instances of a search term aren't given undue priority over more relevant records with fewer instances. Applies only to Salesforce Knowledge records.\n\n\n\n\nRecord Activity\n\n\t\n\nPrioritizes records that are frequently viewed or edited and records that have more associated records, such as related lists. The creation date of the data doesn't affect result priority.\n\nPrioritizes feed posts by various factors, including a higher number of likes and comments. For Q&A relevance, answers marked as best are prioritized. This prioritization applies only to feed and Napili Q&A posts in Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app when the Top Posts view is selected.\n\nPrioritizes Salesforce Knowledge records by various factors, including ratings and thumbs-up votes.\n\nHow Objects are Ranked in the Top Results Page\n\nWhen you use global search in Lightning Experience, you're taken to the Top Results page first. Top Results lists the results for your most frequently used objects. The search engine uses a couple factors to prioritize objects.\n\nFrequency prioritizes objects that you use most often.\nSearch term prioritizes objects that are commonly associated with a search term. For example, a person's name is more commonly associated with contact or user objects.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
