Learn about the benefits and ROI that your company can get from moving to Lightning Experience and evaluate your production org's readiness for the new interface. Then plan your rollout and change management strategies and align with stakeholders on your transition goals.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nLearn What Makes Lightning Experience So Special\nTo maximize the value of moving your business operations to Lightning Experience, invest some time in learning about the possibilities. The power of Lightning means you can create a user experience that improves workflow and productivity, makes jobs easier and more intuitive, even transforms your business. When you understand your options, you’re well set to design a thoughtful transition that reevaluates existing customizations and eliminates old problems. And you’re armed with the data to make a compelling case to your leadership and other decision makers.\nEvaluate Lightning Experience Benefits and Readiness\nAs you prepare for the transition to Lightning Experience, there are three issues to evaluate: how does the change benefit your company, what work is needed to prepare for the change, and how much will it cost. This is the stage to make the case for moving to Lightning Experience by calculating the return on investment your company will get and defining what your Lightning Experience implementation will look like. Use the information you collect in this stage to define business and technical requirements and the level of effort for your rollout.\nPlan Your Lightning Experience Rollout\nAfter completing an evaluation to understand your business goals and technical issues, pull your research together into a plan for rolling out Lightning Experience. As part of the plan, decide on the strategies for moving users to the new interface (all at once or in groups) and for preparing them for the coming change. We recommend rolling out in phases, starting with a pilot, so you don’t have to do everything at once and can learn and refine as you go. The same goes for your rollout plan. Don’t over-plan now and iterate on priorities after each group that you transition.\nAlign with Stakeholders on Your Lightning Experience Transition\nWrap up the Discover phase by aligning with executive leadership and affected stakeholders on the case for Lightning Experience. Make sure that there’s consensus on the business goals, technical requirements, and your rollout and change management strategies. You need this group to green light your plans and allocate resources for the work. And having your leadership’s support is key to building trust with users and helping them understand that moving to Lightning Experience is beneficial and worth their time.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
