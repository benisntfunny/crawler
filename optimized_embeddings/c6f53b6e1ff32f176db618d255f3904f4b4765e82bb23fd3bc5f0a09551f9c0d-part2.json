There can be snags with bookmarks and sharing links in emails or Chatter posts—especially if only a subset of your users are working in Lightning Experience.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nThe Lightning Experience User permission and a user’s default interface affect the way links resolve for each user in your org. A user’s default interface isn’t static.\n\nA user’s initial default interface is determined by when they were added to Salesforce.\nAll users who existed at the time Lightning Experience was enabled in your org keep Salesforce Classic as their default interface. This is true whether an existing user already had the Lightning Experience User permission or is assigned the user permission at a later date.\nUsers who are added to your org after Lightning Experience was enabled get Lightning Experience as their default interface at the time they’re assigned the Lightning Experience User permission.\nIf you switch a user to Lightning Experience—either from the Switch User tool in the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant or by assigning the Hide Option to Switch to Salesforce Classic permission—their default interface resets to Lightning Experience.\nAny time someone uses the Switcher, that user’s default interface resets to the current environment.\nWhen switching from Classic to Lightning Experience, if the URL contains nooverride=1 in Classic, it changes to nooverride=true in Lightning, and you don’t see overrides for the record you’re navigating to.\nRunning Classic and Lightning Experience in different browser tabs or windows is not supported and can cause unexpected behavior in the look and feel of your org and the values returned by the $User.UITheme and $User.UIThemeDisplayed fields. For example, if your org is using Lightning Experience, but you switch to Classic in a different browser tab, these fields return a Classic theme in both tabs.\n\nHere are the typical link routing interactions your users can encounter.\n\nUSER HAS THE “LIGHTNING EXPERIENCE USER” PERMISSION?\tUSER’S DEFAULT INTERFACE\tWHERE LINKS OPEN\nYes\tLightning Experience\t\n\nFor pages supported in Lightning Experience, links open in the new interface (even for links generated in Salesforce Classic).\n\nLinks to unsupported pages are directed to Salesforce Classic, which opens in a new tab. This temporary redirection doesn’t change the user’s default interface to Salesforce Classic. The next time the user selects a link that is supported in the new interface, the Salesforce Classic tab is reloaded to open the link in Lightning Experience.\n\nTo share a Lightning Experience link with other users, make sure that they are logged in to Salesforce first. Otherwise, the link prompts them to log in and then directs them to the home page.\n\n\nYes\tSalesforce Classic\t\n\nLinks usually open in Salesforce Classic.\n\nIf a link was generated in Lightning Experience, the link opens in Lightning Experience. The user’s default interface doesn’t change to Lightning Experience.\n\n\nNo\tSalesforce Classic\t\n\nLinks open in Salesforce Classic only.\n\nIf a link was generated in Lightning Experience, the link doesn’t open, because the user can’t access Lightning Experience.\n\nGiven these routing behaviors, you can see the potential for confusion when users share Lightning Experience links with Salesforce Classic users. To minimize link issues, give Lightning Experience access to all users who work closely together. And train your Lightning Experience users to understand how links and bookmarks work across the two experiences.\n\nTo avoid link issues altogether, move your entire org to Lightning Experience and turn off access to Salesforce Classic for everyone.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSet Up User Access to Lightning Experience\nSalesforce Classic Doesn’t Go Away When You Move Users to Lightning Experience\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
