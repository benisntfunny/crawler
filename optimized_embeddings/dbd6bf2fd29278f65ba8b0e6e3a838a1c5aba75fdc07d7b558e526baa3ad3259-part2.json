Both types of apps are accessible in Lightning Experience. Upgrade your org’s Classic apps to Lightning apps to add branding and record views that are tailored to your users.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nClassic apps are created and managed in Salesforce Classic. Lightning apps are created and managed in Lightning Experience. You can customize both types of apps, but Lightning apps include more features to match the way your users work.\n\nCreate record views that are tailored to your users’ needs.\nInclude Lightning page tabs in an app’s navigation bar for quick access.\nDisplay productivity tools, like Notes, Recent Items, and Sales Dialer, by adding a utility bar.\nCustomize an app with a unique theme.\n\nFind all your apps in the App Launcher.\n\nAll your org’s custom Classic apps and most of your org’s standard Classic apps are available in Lightning Experience. Most Classic console apps have been replaced by standard Lightning apps. If a Classic console app isn’t available in Lightning Experience, you can recreate it with the Lightning App Builder.\n\nNext Steps: Make the Move to Lightning Apps\nFind out more about Lightning apps.\nUpgrade Classic apps to Lightning apps. The upgrade process turns a copy of your Classic app into a Lightning app, leaving the original version untouched.\nIf your users use Classic console apps regularly, recreate them as Lightning apps.\nFollow the instructions tocreate Lightning apps when you make new apps for your org.\nConsult Salesforce App considerations to avoid complications.\nWhen you no longer need a custom Classic app, remove it from the Lightning Experience App Launcher.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
