Ensure that it’s unique for each record.\nSelect the question data type.\nSelect a question category.\nIf the question points to a related question, in the Related Question search field, search for and select the related question.\nSelecting related questions creates hierarchical questions. Related question is the parent record.\nNOTE You can create only one level of hierarchy. Here’s an example of one-level hierarchical questions:\n\nParent Question: Is your onboarding process subject to regular audit and review? (Yes/No)\n\nChild question 1: If Yes, mention the frequency of the audit review.\n\nChild question 2: If No, provide the reasoning below.\n\nIf the question is of data type Formula, in the Formula Response Data Type picklist, select the data type of the question response that the formula calculates.\nWhen the data type of the question is Formula, the Formula Response Data Type field is a required field.\nIf you disabled Enhanced Questions, you must manually create the assessment question version record.\nSave your work.\nOn the assessment question record page, click the Related tab.\nIn the Assessment Question Version related list, click New.\nIn the Name field, enter a name for the record.\nIn the Question Text area, enter the question text.\nTo make this question the active version, select Active.\nNOTE The question label on a form is derived from the question text field from the active version of the question.\nIn the Response Values area, enter the response values.\nNOTE When the question is either of the data type Radio, Radio Group, Select, or Multiselect, Response Values is a required field. Enter response values with each value on a new line. Alternatively, for Select, Multiselect, and Radio, you can also define the response values later as Option Source (SObject or Custom only) in OmniStudio Designer.\nFor Select, Multiselect, and Radio question types, if you want to define the response values later as Option Source (SObject or Custom only) in OmniStudio Designer, then select Option Source Response Value.\nIn the Help Text field, enter explanatory text.\nThis text appears in an infobubble for the UI element that's related to this question on the form.\nSave your changes.\nNOTE By creating question versions, you can track changes to a question and use the data for auditing purposes. If you don’t set the version as Active, then the default status of the question is Draft. When you create a version, the previous question version, if it exists, is automatically marked as Archived.\nAssign Questions to Question Sets\nA question set is a collection of questions. Question sets make it easier to reuse questions across contexts, such as to search for questions and add them to a form. Users can use the Assessment Question Assignments related list to assign questions to question sets.\nImport Data Into Salesforce\nUse any of several methods to import assessment questions, assessment question sets, and assessment question versions into Salesforce.\nSupported Data Types for Questions\nWhen you create a question, the data type that you select corresponds to an OmniScript element that you can add to the OmniScript structure.\nSEE ALSO\nSupported Data Types for Questions\nConfigure Question Creation Settings\nAssign Questions to Question Sets\nConsiderations for Working with Discovery Framework\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
