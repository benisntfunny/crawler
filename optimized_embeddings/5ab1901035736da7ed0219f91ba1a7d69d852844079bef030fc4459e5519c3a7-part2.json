Manage multiple records on a single screen and reduce time spent clicking and scrolling to quickly find, update, and create records.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\n\n\nAvailable in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nLightning console apps are available for an extra cost to users with Salesforce Platform user licenses for certain products. Some restrictions apply. For pricing details, contact your Salesforce account executive.\n\nLightning console apps are available in the Essentials edition in Lightning Experience only.\n\nThe console is perfect for Sales and Service folks. Support agents can use multiple applications at once and keep the context of cases as priorities change. Sales reps have all the tools at their fingertips to cultivate leads, close deals, and manage relationships.\n\nAdministrators can customize a console to determine everything from the objects in the navigation tab, to whether you can place phone calls with a softphone. Customizations can also include displaying knowledge base articles alongside cases, creating custom actions with keyboard shortcuts, or chatting with customers over the web with Chat.\n\nDevelopers can help solve unique business problems with custom console components and use the Salesforce Console API to add third-party integrations.\n\nNOTE You can create console apps in Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience. When working with Lightning console apps, keep the following things in mind.\n\nLightning console apps don’t yet have full parity with Salesforce Classic console apps. For example, some features in Salesforce Classic console apps, such as push notifications and custom keyboard shortcuts, aren’t available in Lightning console apps. Learn more.\n\nYou can’t upgrade Salesforce Classic console apps to Lightning Experience from Setup. To get started in Lightning Experience, customize these Salesforce-provided Lightning console apps: Service Console and Sales Console.\n\nHow Are Console Apps Different from Standard Apps?\nApps with standard navigation let you open a single record at a time. However, apps with console navigation let you open multiple records at a time, and related records open in subtabs under the original record.\nPlan Your Salesforce Console Implementation\nDetermine whether your console is for Service, Sales, or a unique business need. Think about your console users and what information they need most.\nSalesforce Console in Salesforce Classic\nGet started with the Salesforce console in Salesforce Classic.\nSalesforce Console in Lightning Experience\nGet started with the Salesforce console in Lightning Experience.\nSalesforce Console Limitations\nUnderstand the limitations of the Salesforce Console.\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Console Implementation Guide for Salesforce Classic\nSalesforce Console Developer Guide\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
