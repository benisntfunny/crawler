This step helps you identify who your privileged users are. It gives you the data for planning a phased rollout, and provides insight into the level of effort for your project. Salesforce admins and other privileged users are your top priority when rolling out MFA. There are several tools you can use to inventory your user base.\n\nAvailable only in: Products built on the Salesforce Platform, including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Analytics Cloud, B2B Commerce Cloud Marketing Cloud—Audience Studio, Marketing Cloud—Account Engagement, Experience Cloud, Platform, Industries products (Consumer Goods Cloud, Financial Services Cloud, Government Cloud, Health Cloud, Manufacturing Cloud, Philanthropy Cloud), and Salesforce Essentials\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Developer, and Contact Manager Editions\nTIP To understand the benefits of this exercise, see Conduct a User Inventory for Your MFA Implementation.\n\nGet a user inventory template from the downloadable MFA Rollout Pack.\n\nA privileged user is:\n\na Salesforce admin (defined as a user with both the Customize Application and Modify All Data user permissions)\na user with any of these user permissions:\nCustomize Application\nManage Users\nModify All Data\nView All\n\nThere are a few tools you can use to identify admins and other privileged users in your org.\n\nSalesforce Optimizer\nProfile and Permission Set Helper from Salesforce AppExchange\nQuery profile and permission set objects\nFind Salesforce Admins with Salesforce Optimizer\n\nThe Optimizer app is the easiest way to identify all admins in your org. From Setup in Lightning Experience, type Optimizer in the Quick Find box, then select Optimizer. In the Salesforce Optimizer App section, click Open Optimizer. Click Run Optimizer. It can take a while for Optimizer to generate results. In the Feature column, click Admin Permissions. Review the list of users who currently have admin permissions.\n\nFind All Privileged Users with Profile and Permission Set Helper\n\nUse the Profile and Permission Set Helper tool from AppExchange to identify all of the privileged users in your org. The tool searches your org’s profiles and permission sets for a specific user permission, then displays all users who have the permission.\n\nDownload and install the Profile and Permission Set Helper package from AppExchange. Select Permission Set Helper from App Launcher. Click the Permissions Analyzer tab. Make these settings in the sidebar:\n\nAnalyze by field\tSelect Permission\nPermission type field\tSelect User\nPermission field\t\n\nSelect one of the privileged permissions:\n\nCustomize Application\nManage Users\nModify All Data\nView All\n\nThe app displays all users who have been assigned the selected permission, either through a permission set or their profile.\n\nRepeat these steps to search for each of the privileged user permissions.\n\nQuery Your Org’s Data\n\nYou can inventory user permissions that are assigned in permission sets and profiles directly through the API and SOQL. This approach offers the most flexibility for data exporting and analysis.\n\nTo run a query for all users who are assigned any of the four privileged permissions via profiles:\n\nSELECT Id,Username, Profile.Name, Profile.PermissionsCustomizeApplication, \nProfile.PermissionsModifyAllData, Profile.PermissionsManageUsers, Profile.PermissionsViewAllData\nFROM User \nWHERE IsActive = true and (Profile.PermissionsModifyAllData=true \nOR Profile.PermissionsCustomizeApplication=true \nOR Profile.PermissionsManageUsers=true)\n\nTo run a query for all users who are assigned any of the four privileged permissions via permission sets:\n\nSELECT Assignee.Id, Assignee.Username, Assignee.Profile.Name, PermissionSet.Label, \nPermissionSet.PermissionsCustomizeApplication, \nPermissionSet.PermissionsModifyAllData, PermissionSet.PermissionsManageUsers, PermissionSet.PermissionsViewAllData \nFROM PermissionSetAssignment \nWHERE Assignee.IsActive = true AND PermissionSet.IsOwnedByProfile=false AND \n(PermissionSet.PermissionsModifyAllData=true \nOR PermissionSet.PermissionsCustomizeApplication=true \nOR PermissionSet.PermissionsManageUsers=true)\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
