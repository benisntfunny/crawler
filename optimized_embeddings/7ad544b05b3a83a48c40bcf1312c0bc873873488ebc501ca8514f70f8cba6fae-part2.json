Who are you trying to reach? How and when are the best ways to reach them? Answering these questions helps you choose the right flow to start with, and decide how to add to your campaign.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\nEXAMPLE\n\nSingle email\n\nAt Ursa Major Solar, Erin and Lance are planning a flash sale on heat pumps. They want to encourage their solar customers to add or convert to heat pumps, so they create a targeted segment and use a single email campaign to reach their audience.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nSignup form\n\nErin and Lance are working on plans to host a mixer for the Alternative Energies Expo. They decide to offer a QR code that links to an interest form hosted on a landing page. Erin creates a signup form campaign and customizes the content. After Erin activates the URL alias for the landing page, Lance copies the public URL to use with their QR code.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nMessage Series\n\nAfter the Alternative Energies Expo, the team is back in the office and hoping to follow up with the new people they met. Working with customer pros Lincoln and Ada, they develop a timely email series to educate and nurture the people who expressed an interest in solar technology.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nSignup form with follow-up\n\nErin and Lance want to create an automated, multitouch lead funnel for Ursa Major Solar. They start with a signup form as the starting point for their campaign. After their customized signup form and landing page are ready to go, they want to follow up with people who submit their form.\n\nThey create a segment of people who submitted the form, and add a Message Series flow to their campaign. They use decision splits and wait times to make sure their messages are sent to the right people, at the right time. After everything is set up, they’re ready to activate each flow and share their landing page in social posts, emails, and more.\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nSingle email with Einstein\n\nErin and Lance are asked to send an email campaign to advertise the latest product offerings at Ursa Solar Major by the end of the week. They also need a campaign brief to show to their stakeholders. Erin and Lance decide to save time and create a campaign with Einstein.\n\nWith a few simple prompts, Einstein provides content to get them started. Einstein even drafts a segment for them based on their goals. Erin and Lance review the suggestions, adjust the language to better fit their needs, and then launch their campaign.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSegment-Triggered Campaign Flows in Marketing Cloud Growth\nForm-Triggered Campaign Flows in Marketing Cloud Growth\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
