They also determine the associated health verification processing on the backend.\n\nNOTE You’re allowed only one Occasion Rule & Regulation per Occasion Setting.\n\nIn each Occasion Setting record, you can configure details like the Health Verification form name and the graphic to include and which verification types are acceptable for the Occasion Setting.\n\nAny graphic used by Health Verification must be stored as a static resource.\n\nTo create an Occasion Setting, complete these steps.\n\nFrom the Occasion object, click Related.\nFrom the Occasion Settings section, click New.\nEnter an Occasion Setting Name.\nEnter an Event Date.\nCreate an Occasion Rule & Regulation for an Occasion Setting.\nFor instructions, see Create Occasion Rules and Regulations for an Occasion Setting.\nSave your changes.\nAdd a Logo for an Occasion Setting\nYou can add an image to the included static resource for an Occasion Setting. Images can include graphical elements such as a company logo or other images to enhance or customize the form’s appearance. Adding a logo or other image to the Occasion Setting is optional.\nCreate Occasion Rules and Regulations for an Occasion Setting\nUse the Occasion Rules & Regulations that come with Safety Cloud to stipulate which verification methods and vaccination and testing time ranges are acceptable for Health Verification. You can also configure your own Occasion Rules & Regulations based on event-specific requirements.\nSEE ALSO\nCreate an Occasion\nCreate Occasion Access Settings\nSet up a Digital Experience Site with the Health Verification Form\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
