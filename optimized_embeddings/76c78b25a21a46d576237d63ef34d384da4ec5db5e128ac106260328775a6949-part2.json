Lead Scores available in list views and record detail pages in the Salesforce app.\nAvailable with Sales Cloud Einstein, which is available for an extra cost in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\nTraining and Certification\nWhat training and certification resources are available for Sales Cloud Einstein?\nA Sales Cloud Einstein accredited professional certification is available. Preparation materials are available at Salesforce.com. Exam preparation takes about 10 hours.\nAccredited Professional Exam—Sales Cloud Einstein\nExam Preparation Curriculum—Einstein AI for Sales Cloud\nExam Guide—Sales Cloud Einstein Accredited Professional Exam Guide\nWhat Trailhead badges are there for Sales Cloud Einstein?\nThe Sales Cloud Einstein badge is available on the Trailblazer website.\nValue for Your Company\nHow can I estimate the return on investment I can expect from Sales Cloud Einstein?\nBefore enabling Sales Cloud Einstein, Salesforce customers can use the Einstein Value Assessor to learn approximately how much value Einstein Lead Scoring can provide for their company.\n\nProspective Salesforce customers can also use the assessor to estimate its value for their company by answering a few simple questions.\n\nAfter you enable Einstein Lead Scoring, the Einstein Lead Scoring Value dashboard, built with CRM Analytics, can show you specifics about how Lead Scoring is working in your company. The dashboard is available on AppExchange.\n\nData Accessibility\nCan I export lead scores from Salesforce?\nNo. Scores are available only on lead records, list views, and reports.\nCan I use the Lead Score field in Process Builder or Flow?\nYes, both Process Builder and Flow can use the Lead Score field.\nGlobal Models\nWhat determines when Einstein Lead Scoring uses a global model or a local model?\nWhen you score all leads together without creating segments, and you don’t have enough lead conversion data to build your own predictive model, Einstein uses a global model. The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough lead data, Einstein builds a local scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\nWhat data does Einstein use for its global scoring model?\nEinstein uses standard lead fields to build the global model. Einstein omits some standard fields that can contain sensitive information or have no correlation to lead conversion.\nDoes Einstein anonymize the lead data used by the global model?\nYes, lead data used by the global model doesn’t include any personal information or data that connects it to your company.\nIf Einstein uses the global model, can I score my leads in segments?\nNo, when you segment your leads, Einstein can’t use the global model. If one of your segments lacks enough data to build an effective model, leads in that segment aren’t scored.\nCan I choose not to let Einstein use my data in the global model?\nYes, you can opt out of contributing data to the model. See Knowledge article Salesforce Einstein: Global Model Opt-Out Process.\nLocal Models\nHow often does Einstein score your leads?\nEinstein refreshes your lead scores multiple times each day.\nDoes Einstein score leads without related activities?\nEinstein scores new leads that don’t yet have any related activities. Leads with no new or updated activities for the last 200 days aren’t scored.\nHow can I score leads separately for different departments within my company?\nTo score leads in separate groups, create lead segments in Setup. Create segments based on up to 35 field criteria that distinguish the leads for each department.\nHow much data does Einstein need and how can I help Einstein provide the most meaningful scores?\nEncourage sales reps to add as much data as possible to their leads. When leads have more data, Einstein Lead Scoring generates more meaningful scores.\nEinstein needs at least 1,000 leads created in the last 200 days.\nOf the leads created in the last 200 days, at least 120 must be converted to an account and contact.\nCan Einstein create a model for leads converted to accounts and contacts and for leads converted to accounts, contacts, and opportunities?\nWhen you set up Einstein Lead Scoring to look at leads that have converted to accounts and contacts, leads that have converted with opportunities are included. When you set up Einstein Lead Scoring to look at leads that convert with opportunities, leads that only convert to an account and contact aren’t included.\nWhich lead fields does Einstein use to create my scoring model, and are those fields weighted differently?\nIf you use the default settings in Einstein Lead Scoring Setup, Einstein considers all supported standard and custom lead fields when creating your model. If you choose a custom configuration, only the fields you specify are considered when creating your model. The model considers all fields equally and identifies the field values that have the highest correlation with lead conversion.\nDoes the lead scoring model detect or include seasonal trends?\nEinstein Lead Scoring builds its model based on the patterns in your closed leads during the past 3 years. Einstein doesn’t explicitly look for seasonal trends, but if your lead conversion patterns contain seasonality, Einstein detects that and includes it in your lead scores.\nIf I don't use Salesforce in English, can Einstein Lead Scoring work with my leads?\nYes, Einstein can build a model and score leads based on lead data in any language.\nCan I customize the Einstein Lead Scoring component?\nYou can customize the location of the component on your page layouts.\nCan I customize how Einstein builds my lead scoring model?\nYes, you can tell Einstein to score your leads in separate segments based on field values, and you can choose which lead fields to include when building your model.\nCan Einstein include external data when building a model and scoring leads?\nYes, if you add external data to your leads by using custom lead fields, Einstein can include that data.\nWhat determines the top positives and top negatives that appear in the Einstein Lead Scoring component for each lead?\nEinstein determines the top positives and negatives that appear for a lead based on the lead conversion patterns it finds when analyzing your lead conversion history. A top positive is a field value that correlates well with your past lead conversions and increases the lead score. A top negative is a field value that correlates with leads that didn’t convert and decreases the lead score.\nCan I exclude top positives or top negatives from a lead’s score?\nYou can’t exclude specific positives or negatives from a score. You can tell Einstein to omit specific fields from the scoring model, but that excludes those fields from being used to score all your leads.\nCan leads with different scores have the same top positive or top negative?\nYes, because many field values can contribute to a lead’s score, multiple leads can have similar top positives and top negatives but with different scores.\nWhy do some leads have a score without showing any top positives or top negatives?\nWhen no individual field value has a significant effect on the score, no top positives or negatives appear. For these leads, many field values combine to determine the score, with no fields standing out above the rest.\nHow can I understand and evaluate my lead scoring model?\nEinstein Lead Scoring includes a CRM Analytics Einstein Lead Scoring dashboard that provides insights into which lead characteristics result in the most conversions. See how well lead scores correlate to conversion rates, monitor the average lead score of each lead source, and view other statistics.\nData Storage\nWhere does Einstein store lead scoring data?\nEinstein stores the data it uses for your lead analysis and your scoring model on Amazon Web Services servers in the United States.\nDoes Einstein Lead Scoring affect my company’s Salesforce data storage limits?\nNo, Einstein Lead Scoring doesn't change your data storage usage.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
