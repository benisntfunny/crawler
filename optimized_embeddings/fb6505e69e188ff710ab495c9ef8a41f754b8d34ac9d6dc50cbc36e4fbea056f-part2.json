Use the Privacy Center app to create unique policies, manage requests, and monitor the status and results of scheduled jobs.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Developer, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with the Privacy Center license.\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create and manage Privacy Center policies:\tModify All Data AND Manage Privacy Policies\n\nUse Privacy Center on the Salesforce platform, released in Winter ‘24. For the managed package version of Privacy Center that uses Heroku for retention, see Legacy Privacy Center: Satisfy Customer Requests and Data Privacy Laws.\n\nThe privacy Center was created to meet general privacy law requirements. But it’s also a solution for more specific regulations, like the GDPR. Privacy Center can directly assist with these GDPR principles.\n\nData Access: An individual’s right to confirm with a data controller whether the organization is processing their personal data. If it is, the individual has the right to be informed about how and why that information is processed, and what other parties the information has been shared with.\nRestriction of Processing: An individual’s right to request that a controller stop accessing and modifying their personal data.\nData Portability: An individual’s right to ask a controller to provide their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. For example, the information can be transmitted to another company in a JSON file.\nRight to Erasure, or the Right to be Forgotten: An individual’s right to request that a data controller delete or remove their personal data. This right applies to situations when the data is no longer needed for the original purpose and when the data subject withdraws consent. Another situation is when the data subject requests to end the processing, and the controller has no overriding legitimate interest in the processing.\n\nFrom the App Launcher, enter and select Privacy Center. Access every Privacy Center feature from the app home page, including links to resources on privacy laws.\n\nEnable Access to Privacy Center\nGive users access to Privacy Center through permission sets.\nMask and Delete Data with Data Management Policies\nData privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires businesses to minimize the amount of personal data stored. For the data that businesses choose to store, they can be required to pseudo-anonymize or anonymize that data as much as possible. To stay compliant with privacy law, businesses can use the Data Management Policies feature in Privacy Center to automate how data is deleted or masked.\nDelete Data with Right to Be Forgotten Policies\nFor data subjects who want their data to be erased, create Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF) policies to run on individual customer records. Create policies that capture the objects you want to delete or make anonymous, then manually run the policy on a specific record at any time.\nView and Manage Privacy Jobs\nSee details about the jobs for your Data Management and Right to Be Forgotten policies. You can also cancel, reschedule, or immediately run privacy jobs.\nExport Policies Between Sandbox and Production\nYou can export privacy policies directly between your sandbox and production org. Use this feature to develop, test, and troubleshoot privacy policies while quickly converting them between your Salesforce environments.\nPrivacy Policy Tip Sheet\nKeep these tips and best practices in mind while implementing Data Management or Right to Be Forgotten policies.\nUse Privacy Hold to Preserve Records from Processing\nFor legal or business purposes, designate a record to be preserved from masking or deletion by Data Management policies in Privacy Center.\nSEE ALSO\nData Deletion: Delete Personal Data\nConsent Management: Track Customer Consent and Honor Opt-Out Requests\nRestriction of Processing: Restrict How to Process Personal Data\nData Access and Portability: Give Customers Their Data when They Want It\nLegacy Privacy Center: Satisfy Customer Requests and Data Privacy Laws\nUse Preference Manager to Gather Communication Preferences\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
