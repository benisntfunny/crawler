In Monitor Workflow Services, you can view the status of a Data Processing Engine definition's run and its individual tasks. In the Data Manager of Data Pipelines, monitor the data sync and the recipe for the run.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Professional Editions with Financial Services Cloud, Manufacturing Cloud, Loyalty Management, Net Zero Cloud, Rebate Management, Accounting Subledger, or Provider Search in Health Cloud\nWorkflow\n\nA Batch Job record is automatically created after a run starts. In Monitor Workflow Services, use the Batch Job record to track the status of the run. After the Batch Job record is created, the Data Manager of Data Pipelines syncs the definition's source object data and creates a recipe to process the data. The recipe executes all the nodes of the definition and sends the data back to Data Processing Engine, which then writes the data back to your definition's target objects.\n\nView the Status and Details of Definition Runs\nUse Monitor Workflow Services to see whether a Data Processing Engine definition’s run is In Process, Completed, Canceled, or Failed. To troubleshoot failed definition runs, see the error message associated with the run.\nView the Status of Data Extracts for Definitions Runs\nWhen you run a definition, the data sync jobs run to extract data from each Salesforce object that’s selected as a data source. For example, if the definition pulls data from the Opportunity and Account objects, a separate data sync appears for each object. After the data syncs complete, the definition runs. To view the status of data syncs and Data Processing Engine definitions, use the Monitor tab on Data Monitor.\nView the Number of Node Records Processed in a Definition Run\nTo view the number of records processed by individual nodes in a Data Processing Engine definition, select the nodes at the time of running the definition. You can select up to 10 nodes from the definition. When the definition runs, you can view the number of records processed for the selected nodes in Monitor Workflow Services.\nDelete a Run\nDelete runs that are complete, failed, or have been canceled. When you delete a run, its tasks are also deleted.\nLearn About Issues in Your Data Processing Engine Definition\nUse the Data Manager to determine why a definition isn’t writing back results. Issues can be caused by the definition’s design or the data available in the Salesforce org.\nView Failed Writeback Records\nIf a definition run fails during the writeback process, view the failed records to identify what went wrong in Monitor Workflow Services.\nSEE ALSO\nData Processing Engine Workflow\nRun the Definition to Update Purchase Credit and Bonus\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
