Setup for Einstein generative AI is available in Lightning Experience.\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with an Einstein for Sales, Einstein for Platform, or Einstein for Service add-on. To purchase the Einstein for Sales, Einstein for Platform, or Einstein for Service add-on, contact your Salesforce account executive.\n\nTo understand how the Einstein Trust Layer works, let’s look at how data flows through the Trust Layer and then walk through each part of the journey in detail.\n\nThe data in the form of a prompt, flows from CRM apps, through the Einstein Trust Layer, to the large language model (LLM), which we’ll call prompt journey.\nThe LLM generates a response using the prompt, which we’ll call response generation.\nThe generated response then flows back through the Einstein Trust Layer and back to the CRM apps, which we’ll call the response journey.\nNOTE Einstein Trust Layer capabilities apply only to Einstein Generative AI features.\nHow Does It Work?\nPrompt Journey\n\nTo generate a response from the LLM, you must provide it with a prompt. The prompt can come from any of the CRM apps. You can create a prompt in the Prompt Builder or pass it from Apex or a Flow.\n\nSecure Data Retrieval and Grounding\n\nThe first step in the Trust Layer is secure data retrieval. In order for the LLM to generate a response that is more relevant and personalized, it requires additional context from your CRM data. This process of adding additional context to the prompt is what we call grounding. You can ground your prompts using merge fields with CRM data, which can be record fields, flows, Apex, Data Cloud DMOs, and related lists.\n\nSecure data retrieval means that the prompt is grounded only with data that the executing user has access to.\n\nThe data retrieval process respects existing access controls and permissions in Salesforce:\n\nData retrieval for grounding the prompt is based on the permissions of the user executing the prompt.\nData retrieval for grounding the prompt preserves in place all standard Salesforce role-based controls for user permissions and field-level security when grounding data from your CRM instance.\n\nThe grounding is dynamic since the grounding happens at run time and depends on the user's access.\n\nData Masking for the LLM\n\nEinstein Trust Layer policies include data masking, where sensitive data is detected and then masked. We use patterns and context to identify sensitive data. The data is then masked with a placeholder text to prevent the data from being exposed to external models. Einstein Trust Layer temporarily stores the relationship between the original entities and their respective placeholders. The relationship is used later to demask the data in the generated response.\n\nPrompt Defense\n\nTo help decrease the likelihood of the LLM generating something unintended or harmful, Prompt Builder and Prompt Template Connect API use system policies. System policies are a set of instructions to the LLM for how to behave in a certain manner to build trust with users. For example, we can instruct the LLM to not address content or generate answers that it doesn’t have information about. System policies are one way to defend against jailbreaking and prompt injection attacks.\n\nResponse Generation\n\nAfter a prompt is fully hydrated and secured, it’s ready to be sent through the LLM gateway. The gateway governs interactions with different model providers and represents a unified, secure way to communicate with multiple LLMs. The gateway and model providers use TLS encryption to make sure the data is secured during transit.\n\nModels built or fine-tuned by Salesforce are hosted in the Salesforce trust boundary. External Models built and maintained by third-party providers, such as OpenAI, are in a shared trust boundary. Models that you build and maintain are hosted on your infrastructure.\n\nWe have a zero data retention policy in place with external partner model providers, such as OpenAI or Azure Open AI. The policy states that data sent to the LLM from Salesforce isn’t retained and is deleted after a response is sent back to Salesforce.\n\nNext: Review the Einstein Trust Layer: Response Journey to see how the Einstein Trust Layer helps make sure the generated response is safe and usable.\n\nSEE ALSO\nEinstein Trust Layer: Response Journey\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
