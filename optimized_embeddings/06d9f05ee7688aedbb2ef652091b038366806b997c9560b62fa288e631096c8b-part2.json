By using machine learning, Einstein Opportunity Scoring provides a simpler, faster, and more accurate solution than traditional rule-based scoring approaches.\n\nTIP\n\nFor a deeper dive into Einstein Opportunity Scoring, check out the Model Card.\n\nThe Scoring Model\n\nTo predict which opportunities are most likely to be won, Einstein analyzes your and your team’s past closed opportunities (both closed-won and closed-lost) to build a scoring model. The criteria used in the analysis includes the following.\n\nEach opportunity’s record details (both standard and custom fields), history, and related activities\nThe related account’s record details and some record history\nDetails about the related products, quotes, and price books\n\nDuring setup, Salesforce admins can choose whether to have Einstein consider all opportunity records and custom fields or only a subset. When Einstein builds the scoring model, the omitted records and fields are ignored.\n\nIf you don’t have enough opportunity data to build your own predictive model, Einstein uses a global model. The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough opportunity data, Einstein builds a scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\n\nOnce a month, or whenever the admin updates the settings, Einstein reanalyzes the opportunity data and the model is refreshed. Opportunity scores are updated every few hours.\n\nFactors That Contribute to Scores\n\nFor each opportunity score, Einstein shows the factors that have contributed most to the score, both positively and negatively. Sometimes, an opportunity has a score but doesn’t show any factors. This could be because there are too many minor factors for any of them to help understand how the score was calculated. Or, it could be because the factors are complex and, therefore, too difficult to summarize.\n\nFactors are based on your CRM data and accurately contribute to the score, even if they seem counterintuitive. For example, a deal with an enterprise customer requires extra steps, such as legal review and a longer negotiation process. These extra steps delay the close date. But, because the delayed close date signals that the deal is progressing, the delay is associated with a higher score. However, for a deal with an SMB customer that doesn’t include extra steps, a delayed close date is associated with a lower score.\n\nWhen Scores Don’t Appear\n\nA score might not appear on a particular opportunity for one of the following reasons.\n\nThe scores haven’t been calculated yet because Einstein Opportunity Scoring was recently enabled. It can take around 48 hours before scores are available.\nA previously scored opportunity is closed, so the score is removed.\nThe admin excluded the opportunity from Einstein’s scoring process. If the opportunity was previously scored, the score is removed.\nThe opportunity was added less than six hours ago.\nEinstein couldn’t calculate scores because you don’t have enough opportunity data. To check your data, run the Sales Cloud Einstein Assessor.\nIf Opportunity Scoring was turned on by default, scores aren’t available for opportunities that are related to a person account. To get scores for those opportunities, turn off Einstein Opportunity Scoring and then turn it on again.\nWhen Scores Aren’t Recalculated\n\nA previously scored opportunity is more than three months past its closed date. Einstein gives the opportunity a default score of 5.\n\nSEE ALSO\nEinstein Opportunity Scoring\nConsiderations for Setting Up Einstein Opportunity Scoring\nEnable Einstein Opportunity Scoring\nRun the Sales Cloud Einstein Readiness Assessor\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
