When the criteria you define in the send definitions are met, Engagement sends email notifications to users. The context of the email that Engagement sends depends on the criteria specified in the send definition, as defined by the Occasion objects.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions\n\nMake sure that you configured Engagement to send customer Health Verification notifications.\n\nEvery time a Health Verification record is created or edited, the system checks to see if an email confirmation must be sent to the person who submitted the Health Verification form.\n\nThe Email Mapping object specifies the combination of Health Verification record Status and Method values required to send an email to the user.\n\nThe Email Mapping record also specifies the classic email templates to be used for the Header, Body, and Footer values.\n\nThe email templates must be written using merge field markup %%FieldName%% rather than { !FieldName}\n\nThe send definition includes the Definition Key. The API uses the Definition Key to determine whether to send a confirmation email or a status update email, and in what language to send it.\n\nHere’s how it works at run time.\n\nA user submits their Health Verification form on your site.\nThe system generates and stores a Health Verification record for the user.\n\nAn agent can begin working on the verification request.\n\nThe Health Verification record includes data about selections that the user made when submitting the form. The Health Verification record also includes status information based on any work the agent has done processing the request.\n\nEach Occasion Email Mapping that is configured in Health Verification email maps to an Engagement Send Definition.\n\nWhen data from the Health Verification record matches the configuration criteria from the Occasion Email Mapping object, Engagement sends an email.\n\nThis table lists and defines the Occasion Email Mapping fields.\n\nEmail Mapping Field Definitions\nFIELD\tDEFINITION\nOccasion\t\n\nRelated Occasion Record\n\n\nVerification Method\t\n\nMethod the Health Verification record requires to trigger the email.\n\n\nVerification Status\t\n\nStatus the Health Verification record requires to trigger the email.\n\n\nMarketing Cloud Definition Key\t\n\nName of the Send Definition Key for the journey in Engagement.\n\n\nVerification Site URL\t\n\nOptional parameter that can be passed to Engagement and used within the Email template to link users back to the org.\n\n\nLanguage\t\n\nForm language\n\n\nEmail Template Header Name\t\n\nName of the Classic Email template that can be used as HTML content for the header in the Engagement template.\n\nEmail templates can only be 4,000 characters. When a template exceeds 4,000 characters, Engagement truncates the content and the HTML breaks, giving unexpected results.\nYou can’t use Merge Fields in the Classic Email Templates. The merging of values occurs within the Engagement template only. Use the Email Template as an HTML editor.\n\nEmail Template Body Name\t\n\nName of the Classic Email template that can be used as HTML content for the body in the Engagement template\n\nEmail templates can only be 4,000 characters. When a template exceeds 4,000 characters, Engagement truncates the content and the HTML breaks, giving unexpected results.\nYou can’t use Merge Fields in the Classic Email templates. The merging of values occurs within the Engagement template only. Use the Email template as an HTML editor.\n\nEmail Template Footer Name\t\n\nName of the Classic Email template that can be used as HTML content for the footer in the Engagement template.\n\nEmail templates can only be 4,000 characters. When a template exceeds 4,000 characters, Engagement truncates the content and the HTML breaks, giving unexpected results.\nYou can’t use Merge Fields in the Classic Email templates. The merging of values occurs within the Engagement template only. Use the Email template as an HTML editor.\n\nThe Occasion Email Mapping object serves as a bridge for Classic HTML templates, which is an out-of-the-box feature, and the Engagement Email template. It specifies the Engagement Email template (Definition Key), and the Classic HTML email header, footer, and body.\n\nSafety Cloud uses the template to pass content into the Engagement Email, which is eventually sent to the scheduled batch job to the related person account records.\n\nUse the Occasion Email Mapping object to create the mappings between classic email templates and Engagement emails decoratively, as described here.\n\nFrom the App Launcher, type Occasion Email Mappings, and then select Occasion Email Mappings.\nSelect a preconfigured mapping.\n\nThe values specified in the Email Template Header Name, Email Template Body Name, and Email template Footer Name fields reference the API names of Salesforce Classic Email templates.\n\nThe Engagement Definition Key serves as the reference ID that connects the Salesforce Org and its related Engagement journey. The content is passed to the email in Engagement and Engagement sends the email to the person who’s health status is verified.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSet up Marketing Cloud Engagement to Send Customer Health Verification Notifications\nSet up an Email Template for Health Verification\nSchedule the Confirmation and Verification Emails\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
