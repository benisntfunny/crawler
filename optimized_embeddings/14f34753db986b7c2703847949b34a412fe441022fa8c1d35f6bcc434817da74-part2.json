Need to see a to-do list when you start your day? Don’t have a full-time staff member to run your help center? Have unique metrics you’re holding your support staff to? We’ve got brainstorming questions and best practices around customizing Essentials to meet your needs.\nMake Selling Simple with Sales Stages\nSales stages help you organize how your business closes a deal, starting from lead creation and going all the way through closing an opportunity.\nSync Emails and Activities\nAutomatically bring your business emails and events into Salesforce with Einstein Activity Capture. Then your deals, cases, and contacts will show any related emails and events.\nOffer Customer Support in Essentials\nSalesforce Essentials makes offering customer support easy. Track and solve your customers’ issues with cases, so nothing slips through the cracks. Keep your customers happy with self-service, live web chat and messaging, and phone support.\nLet Your Customers Help Themselves\nGive your customers the gift of self-service. When your customers can answer their own questions, your team can spend more time making deals and solving bigger customer issues. Write and organize articles with Knowledge that provide information about your business and answer common questions. Serve up your categorized articles in a help center so your customers can find exactly what they need. If they have a question that requires human intervention, they can log a case to your team. (Or if you’re feeling spiffy, you can offer live chat, too).\nTurn Emails and Social Media Posts into Cases\nUse Email-to-Case to turn incoming emails to your support email address into cases in Salesforce. Social Customer Service automatically creates cases for social media mentions, posts, or direct messages from your company’s Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram pages. Set up Email-to-Case, Twitter, and Facebook with guided setup flows.\nUse a Phone in Salesforce\nA phone lets your team take and make calls alongside their other work in Salesforce. You can create a phone with Salesforce using Sales Dialer or Dialer for Essentials, or you can integrate a third-party phone product.\nGet the Most from Tasks\nTasks are to-do list items that help you keep track of your workload and meet important business objectives. If you're an individual contributor, you can use task reminders to stay on top of upcoming deadlines. If you're a manager, you can use tasks to align business processes and monitor productivity.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
