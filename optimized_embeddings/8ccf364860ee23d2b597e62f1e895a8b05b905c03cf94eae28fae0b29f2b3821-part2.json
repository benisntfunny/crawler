This feature works with Order Management, B2B Commerce, D2C Commerce, and B2C Commerce.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nTo place orders on behalf of customers, you need either the Order Management Growth License (for Order Management OOBO), or the Connected Commerce bundle (for Order Entry with Commerce).\n\nWhen Order Management and OOBO are implemented, a CSR can place an order on behalf of both registered and guest customers and manage the order using Order Management. To get the product SKU information, Salesforce queries the appropriate data source, either B2C Commerce or Salesforce Commerce, depending on the webstore type. The SKU information includes product variants and standard attributes, pricing, tax, shipping, and some promotions.\n\nOrder Entry requires the Connected Commerce bundle, which includes B2B Commerce, D2C Commerce, and Payments. With Order Entry, a CSR can place an order on behalf of a customer without an Order Management license. When the CSR places the order, Order Entry queries the B2C or B2B storefront for product and pricing information and then creates the order on the Salesforce org. You can also use Order Entry with Salesforce Service Cloud.\n\nOOBO and Order Entry support API-based checkouts only. Aura-based checkout isn’t supported.\n\nImplementing OOBO or Order Entry requires some setup steps.\n\nComplete one of the following\nPurchase and install the Connected Commerce bundle\nPurchase and install Order Management with the Growth License\nObtain a Salesforce org. When you purchase Order Entry through the Connect Commerce bundle, an org is provisioned for you if you don’t already have one.\nInstall and configure Salesforce B2C, D2C, or B2B Commerce. See Salesforce D2C and B2B Commerce Help or Salesforce B2C Commerce Help.\nFor OOBO with B2B Commerce, add your buyer accounts to the appropriate buyer groups.\n\nOOBO and Order Entry use SKUs to query for product information, including variant and attribute information. OOBO and Order Entry provide real-time price lookup, which includes taxes, shipping, and some types of promotions. For example, orders can participate in line-level or order-level promotions. However, some store features aren’t available when you place an order on behalf of a customer.\n\nThese features aren’t supported.\n\nPromotion discounts for a particular payment method.\nThe order can’t participate in bonus promotions, such as when a free product is added to the order when a different product is ordered.\nThe order can’t include warranties.\nOnly a single credit card payment method can be used for the purchase.\nAll items in the order must be shipped to the same address.\nProduct bundles can’t be included in the order.\nProduct options and custom attributes aren’t available.\nThe order can’t participate in coupon-qualified promotions.\nUnmanaged Orders (Order Entry Only)\nOrder Entry doesn’t include any of the order management functions available through Salesforce Order Management.\nOrder on Behalf Of Setup\nAfter you have installed and configured either an Order Management, B2B Commerce, or D2C Commerce org, there are some Order on Behalf Of specific steps to take. Many of these tasks are the same whether you’re using Order Entry or OOBO. However there are a few steps that are specific to the individual products. Complete the steps for your product and organization.\nPlace an Order on Behalf of a Customer\nPlace orders directly for customers from your own device. You can search for products, set variables and quantities, add the products to a cart, and process customer payments.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
