Education Cloud draws on the power of Salesforce to connect insights across recruitment, admissions, and student success for a unified view of every learner's journey. A single source of truth creates a complete student profile, so your institution can offer personalized experiences that translate into successful lifetime learners—from prospective student to engaged alum. With Salesforce at the center of your institution's information technology solution, important tasks can be completed in less time, at scale, and in collaboration between departments. Create an Experience Cloud site to be your institution's learner portal where students start their higher education journey. From this site, prospective students can request information, schedule appointments, and apply to your institution. After a student submits their application, your admissions staff can verify, review, and decide on the application in the individual application record.\n\nLearner Portal\nUse Experience Builder to brand your learner portal, and add ready-to-use or custom Lightning components, layouts, and themes to provide an enhanced student experience. Students can use the portal to apply to programs, track and manage their applications, raise requests for information, and more. You can use the Education Applicant Portal template, or build one from scratch.\nRequest for Information and Response\nProspective students can connect with your staff and inquire about programs and services through your institution's Experience Cloud site.\nApplication Form\nEducation Cloud provides an Experience Cloud Site template for you to use for your institution. The template includes a customizable application form created with OmniStudio that prospective students can use to apply to your institution.\nApplication Intake and Processing\nWhen a prospective student submits an application to your institution, the application goes through the review and approval process. Conduct and manage the process of verifying, reviewing, and deciding on applications all in one place.\nRecruiting and Admissions Consoles\nEducation Cloud consoles give users a central place to focus on application reviews, see critical tasks, and take important next steps. When an admissions director or officer, recruiter, or reviewer opens the Recruitment & Admissions app, they arrive on a home page that's designed for their role and license type.\nAppointment Scheduling\nProvide a central self-service system for managing appointments. Learners have visibility over your staff's availability in any department, based on their configured topics and appointment channels. They can view and schedule appointments, and even join virtually if you set up that feature. Your staff can also schedule appointments on behalf of learners from their records. Unifying all departments on a single scheduling tool increases your learners' ability to use all of your services.\nNew and Changed Objects\nDo more with the new and updated Education Cloud objects.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
