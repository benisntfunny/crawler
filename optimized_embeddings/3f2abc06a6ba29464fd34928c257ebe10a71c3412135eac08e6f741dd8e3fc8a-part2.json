If you installed the Template Package, you must set up the Digital Experience to host the LWC component on an unauthenticated site so your users can access it.\n\nTo set up the Digital Experience Site to host the LWC component, complete these steps.\n\nEnable Digital Experiences, and register a domain.\nUse this format for the domain: YOURSITE-community/force.com. For detailed steps, see Enable Digital Experiences.\nCreate a new Build Your Own (Aura) Site.\nFrom Setup in the Quick Find box, enter Digital Experiences, and then select All Sites.\nClick New.\nSelect the tile Build Your Own (Aura), and click Get Started.\nEnter the name of your site and a custom path, and click Create.\nAfter you’re inside Workspaces for your site, click the Builder tile.\nDelete the placeholder component.\nOpen up the Components panel.\nScroll to the Custom Components section, and find the Health Verification Form component.\nDrag that component into the Content section of the Builder.\nGo to the Settings panel.\nUnder General, check the Guest users can see and interact with the site without logging in checkbox.\nTo support multiple languages, complete these steps.\nWhile still on the Settings panel, go to Languages, and click Add Languages\nAdd any language that you want to support and have translations for already.\nGo back to the Components panel, and search for the built-in Language Selector component.\nDrag the Language Selector component into the Content Footer (recommended) or Content Header.\n\nBecause the Language Selector expands to the full width of the section, we recommend going to the Themes panel and reducing the Max Page Width to 640 px.\n\nGo to the Settings panel.\nClick the user profile linked under Guest User Profile.\nFind Enabled Apex Class Access, and click Edit .\nFind HealthVerificationFormController, and add it to the Enabled Apex Classes.\nSave your work.\nFind Enabled Custom Permissions and click Edit.\nFind HealthVerificationForm Allowed, Safety Cloud.safetycloud.Account Visitor Action Allowed, and Safety Cloud.safetycloud.Health Card Scanner Allowed and add them to the Enabled Custom Permissions.\nSave your work.\nFind Enabled Custom Permissions.\nFind Safety Cloud.safetycloud.Health Card Scanner Allowed, and add it to the Enabled Custom Permissions.\nGo back to the Experience Builder, and on the upper-right corner of the page, click Publish.\nYou receive an email with URL when the site is published.\nVerify that the site works by logging out of Salesforce and going to the site URL.\nYou see a page with the text message No Occasion Found,\n\nThe site can host all events by adding these query parameters to the site URL:\n\n\n?occasionId=<occasionId>&occasionSettingId=<occasionSettingId>\n\n\nAfter adding the query parameters, the site looks like this.\n\nSet up a custom domain so that your Experience Cloud site URLs reflect your company brand.\nSee Configure a Custom Domain for Your Experience Cloud Site.\nSet Salesforce's CDN for Digital Experiences for your domain\nSee Serve Your Experience Cloud Site with the Salesforce Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nSEE ALSO\nCreate an Occasion\nCreate an Occasion Setting\nCreate Occasion Access Settings\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
