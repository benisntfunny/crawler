Then, enable Salesforce Payments for your org and assign permissions to users. Finally, follow a guided setup to create a merchant account and payment method set, which is a group of payment methods you’re willing to accept.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions\nTIP If you’re setting up Payments for a D2C store for the first time, bypass the manual setup tasks. Instead, let the Commerce Setup Assistant enable and configure Payments, and let Salesforce Checkout help you create a merchant account. For more information, see Video: Get Started with Salesforce Commerce and Set Up a Commerce Store.\nSet Up a Channel for Payment Data\nSet up an Experience Cloud site as a channel for payment data to flow from the payment gateway to Salesforce Payments. This site is required to enable Salesforce Payments and it’s used only as a data pipeline. Your customers don’t access this site.\nEnable Salesforce Payments\nSalesforce Payments securely provides payment solutions to improve your customers’ checkout experience. Enable Salesforce Payments on an org with B2B or D2C Commerce. After you enable Payments, you can’t disable it.\nAssign Payments Permissions to Users\nTo configure Payments, at least one individual in your business needs administrative permissions. Typically, your Salesforce admin assigns these permissions.\nPayments Personas and Permissions\nA typical Salesforce Payments implementation involves several task-based personas that require certain permissions to do their jobs.\nRegister Your Domain to Use Apple Pay\nTo offer Apple Pay as a payment method for your store, register your store’s domain name with Apple Pay. You also register an Apple Pay domain for each Salesforce Payments merchant account that accepts Apple Pay. For example, to support Apple Pay on 25 merchant accounts, register 25 times. Apple Pay works only in the Safari web browser for desktop and mobile devices.\nSet Up a Merchant Account and Payment Method Set\nCreate a Salesforce Payments merchant account and a payment method set so that your business can accept electronic payments. A Salesforce Payments merchant account connects to a payment gateway that handles payment processing. A payment method set is a group of payment methods that you’re willing to accept. Supported methods include credit cards, debit cards, direct debit, and digital wallets, and non-card payments methods such as SEPA and iDEAL. Each set is associated with a merchant account.\nGenerate B2C Payment Records in the Payments Workspace\nCentralize all payment activity, including payments from B2C storefronts, in the Payments Workspace. To make B2C payments accessible, create a merchant account in the Payments app that is linked to an existing B2C merchant account associated with Stripe. This account consumes payment data from Stripe and generates payment intents listed in the Payments Workspace. You can distinguish B2C, B2B, or D2C payment intents based on the associated merchant account.\nLet Customers Save Payment Methods for Future Use\nGive customers with registered store accounts the option to save their payment information for future transactions. Saving payment methods reduces checkout time.\nManage Payment Record Access and Sharing\nMaintain strong data access controls by allowing merchant account access to only relevant users. Different merchant accounts can help organize your business by different regions and currencies. Dividing merchant account ownership limits access, which improves security. Ensuring the right people in each geography have necessary account access helps with issues such as regulatory compliance. To distribute responsibilities, merchant account owners can configure sharing on a per-record basis so payment processing runs smoothly.\nCustomize the Payments App Home Page\nYou can customize the Home landing page to display charts that show a snapshot of your payments activity. You can access the entire report directly from the chart.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
