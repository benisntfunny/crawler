This information helps prioritize their needs and create phases for implementing Salesforce. Here are some sample discovery questions that can help nonprofits be explicit about what improvements they are trying to make. By getting clear on what you’re trying to accomplish, not only can you set realistic, phased goals for implementation, but you can also more easily set measures for success and track your progress towards these goals.\nEstablishing Good Governance\nFollowing the principles of good governance provides a clear and consistent framework to manage change over time and defines processes to resolve conflicting requirements.\nDemystifying Digital Transformation\nDigital Transformation is a buzzword that gets thrown around a lot in the tech industry. The advantage of using terms like this is that it gives everyone a common way to refer to something. The disadvantage is that the same term can have many different meanings depending on the context it gets used in and who the audience is. Things can start to become even more confusing over time as industry trends change.\nAvoid Installing NPSP and EDA in the Same Org\nEducation Data Architecture (EDA) and Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP) won't work together in Salesforce.\nSalesforce.org Product Localization\nThis article provides information about Salesforce.org localization and lists the supported languages for each product.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
