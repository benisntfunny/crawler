Some customers start with a basic edition and upgrade to a more feature-rich edition as business requirements evolve.\n\nIt’s easy to learn which features are available in various editions. Just search for features in Salesforce Help. Toward the top of every topic, you can see the editions in which the feature’s available. Here’s a quick description of each edition we offer.\n\nEDITION\tWHAT’S GREAT ABOUT IT\nEssentials\tDesigned for small businesses getting started with CRM to boost sales or service productivity. It includes a setup assistant and administration tools to customize your deployment as you grow.\nStarter\tMade for businesses that need access to simplified setup and built-in onboarding tools. It includes sales, service, and marketing functionality in one suite to help businesses improve productivity across multiple departments.\nPro Suite\t\n\nCreated for businesses that need flexibility, automation, and light integrations with their CRM but that also want out-of-the-box tools to get started quickly. Pro Suite provides key features across sales, service, and marketing business functions along with in-app guidance for getting started.\n\n\nProfessional\tDesigned for businesses requiring full-featured CRM functionality. It includes straightforward and easy-to-use customization, integration, and administration tools to facilitate any small to midsize deployment.\nEnterprise\tMeets the needs of large and complex businesses. It gives you advanced customization and administration tools, in addition to all the functionality available in Professional Edition, that can support large-scale deployments. Enterprise Edition also includes access to Salesforce APIs, so you can easily integrate with back-office systems.\nUnlimited\tMaximizes your success and extends it across the entire enterprise through the Lightning Platform. It gives you new levels of platform flexibility for managing and sharing all your information on demand. Includes all Enterprise Edition functionality, Premier Support, full mobile access, unlimited custom apps, increased storage limits, and other features.\nDeveloper\t\n\nProvides access to the Lightning Platform and APIs. It lets developers extend Salesforce, integrate with other applications, and develop new tools and applications. Developer Edition also provides access to many of the features available in Enterprise Edition.\n\nSalesforce doesn’t provide technical support for Developer Edition. But you can ask for help from developer community message boards after you register for the Lightning Platform developer website: developer.salesforce.com.\n\nFor many trial and purchased subscription editions for new orgs, Lightning Experience is the exclusive user interface for end users.\n\nCompare editions and their features in Salesforce Pricing and Editions.\n\nFind Your Edition\nYour Salesforce edition affects which features and functionality are available in your org.\nLightning Experience–Only Editions\nCustomers using Lightning Experience are more productive than customers working in Salesforce Classic. To ensure that our customers benefit from these productivity gains, selected trials and purchased subscriptions for several editions offer Lightning Experience as the exclusive user interface for end users without admin permissions.\nSalesforce Editions That Are No Longer Sold\nSome Salesforce editions are no longer sold. You can continue to use your Contact Manager, Group, Personal, Performance, or Database.com Edition org or purchase one of the editions that are currently sold: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited. Developer Editions are also still available for free.\nControlled Setting Edition: What’s Different or Unavailable in Controlled Setting Edition\nControlled Setting Edition and Controlled Setting products are versions of Salesforce applications that give customers enhanced control of data flows within Salesforce. The Controlled Setting Edition restricts the use of features that require connections outside of Salesforce. Because of this isolation restriction, some features are unavailable. Controlled Setting Products also restrict the use of features that require external connections or that are turned off by default.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
