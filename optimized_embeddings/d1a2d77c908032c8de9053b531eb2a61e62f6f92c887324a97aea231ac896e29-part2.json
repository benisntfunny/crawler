The data from the Known Issuers directory helps Safety Cloud determine whether the SMART Health Card shared by a card holder is valid and credible.\n\nThe imported data is stored in the Health Card Issuer object.\n\nTo enable the Known Issuers Directory to import Known Issuer data, complete these steps.\n\nFrom the Safety Cloud app, find the Known Issuer Directories Setup tab and select it..\nUsing the toggle, enable the Known Issuer Directories feature.\nUsing the toggle, enable the specific Known Issuers Directory. To get the latest list of known issuers, click Update List.\n\nWhen you enable the VCI™ Directory, Safety Cloud imports the known issuers from the directory and sets up the scheduled daily refresh job. Safety Cloud imports information from the directory as known Health Card Issuer records.\n\nWhen you disable VCI™ Directory, Safety Cloud removes the imported Known Issuers. However, any known issuers that you created manually aren’t removed when you disable the feature.\n\nIf you disable the feature, Safety Cloud removes the scheduled daily refresh job automatically.\n\nEach time a SMART Health Card holder shares their card, Safety Cloud extracts the issuer information from the card and compares it against the known Health Card Issuers records imported from the VCI™ Directory. If there’s a matching Health Card Issuer record in the org, Safety Cloud sets the Is Known Issuer checkbox on the Health Card record to True.\n\nKnowing the SMART Health Card is from a known issuer is key in deciding on whether to trust a credential. With this information, the admin can determine how to automate the health verification process. For example, when Is Known Issuer =True on the Health Card record, they can set Health Verification to Verified.\n\nSEE ALSO\nPoint-of-Entry Health Verification\nConfigure the Visualforce Barcode Scanner Page for Point-of-Entry Verification\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
