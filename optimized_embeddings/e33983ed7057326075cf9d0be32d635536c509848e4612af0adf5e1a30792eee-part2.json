Want to have an organization that users can log into and test new features before they’re production-ready? Or maybe you just want to log into a Salesforce organization for training or development that mirrors your production organization.\n\nWhen to Use a Sandbox\nSandboxes create copies of your Salesforce org in separate environments. Use them for development, testing, and training, without compromising the data and applications in your production org.\nSandbox Setup Considerations\nSandbox behavior is similar to a Salesforce production org, but important differences affect how you configure and test a sandbox org.\nCreate, Clone, or Refresh a Sandbox\nCreate a sandbox to use for development, testing, and training. Clone a sandbox to copy its data and metadata into another sandbox. Refresh an existing sandbox to update its contents.\nManage Your Sandboxes\nIn Setup, enter Sandboxes in the Quick Find box, then select Sandboxes. Sandboxes displays the available sandboxes that you purchased and a list of your sandboxes in use.\nManage Your Sandboxes Programmatically\nUse Salesforce CLI to authorize in to, create, and clone sandboxes. Traditionally, admins create and manage sandboxes through the Setup UI. But we realize that many admins and developers want the ability to create and manage their development and testing environments programmatically, and to automate their CI processes. Salesforce CLI enables you to do both.\nInactive Sandbox Expiration\nTo better utilize capacity and support growth, we perform a routine cleanup of inactive sandboxes. A sandbox is considered inactive and eligible for deletion if it hasn’t been accessed for 180 days.\nInactive User Freezing\nUsers who haven’t logged in to a Developer or Developer Pro sandbox within the first 60 days based on the time the user was created are frozen. This feature can’t be disabled.\nDeploy Your Changes\nMigrate metadata changes between Salesforce orgs by using the deployment tools available in Setup.\nSecure Your Sandbox Data with Salesforce Data Mask\nData Mask is a powerful data security resource for Salesforce admins and developers. Instead of manually securing data and access for sandbox orgs, admins can use Data Mask to automatically mask the data in a sandbox. Data Mask enables admins and developers to mask sensitive data in sandboxes such as personally identifiable information (PII) or sales revenue.\nSEE ALSO\nScale Test\nSalesforce Help: Data Cloud in a Sandbox (Beta)\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
