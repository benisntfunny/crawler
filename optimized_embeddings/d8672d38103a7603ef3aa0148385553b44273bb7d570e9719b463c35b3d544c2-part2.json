This means that you must delete, archive, or de-identify the data subject’s PII in your org within 30 days of their request. Always work with your legal team to ensure that you collaborate on policy creations and meet requirements set by your company. With Privacy Center, you can obfuscate a customer's PII, move it to storage, or delete it.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: all editions\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo retain customer information using Heroku:\tModifyAllData and PrivacyCenter\n\nTo obfuscate customer data, Privacy Center can replace your customer’s data with either random characters, known as anonymization, or mock data, known as pseudonymization. Privacy Center can also retain customer data by putting it into storage using Heroku Connect. While this data is retained it can’t be processed or accessed by other users. Privacy Center can completely delete a user’s record and any related information from your Salesforce org. Unlike retained data, these records are permanently deleted after the Recycle Bin clears, either through manual clearance by a user or after the 15-day expiration limit.\n\nData Retention Policies\nCreate data retention policies with the Data Retention feature. Using Heroku for data processing and storage, these policies automate how PII is stored, retained, and anonymized in Salesforce.\nCreate and Customize Retention Policies for Data and Storage\nUse the Retention Policies feature to create policies that copy customer data and store it. You can also make PII anonymous in your org and in the data retention store. Or, you can delete data from your org when it copies to the retention store. Choose to anonymize fields or records by replacing them with random characters or mock data.\nRun Your Retention Policy\nPut your policy into practice by executing it. You can only run activated policies, and retention policy executions aren’t reversible.\nHeroku Storage: Data Retention Store\nPrivacy Center uses Heroku as a data retention store. When you choose to retain customer information, it’s placed in Heroku’s storage for safekeeping.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
