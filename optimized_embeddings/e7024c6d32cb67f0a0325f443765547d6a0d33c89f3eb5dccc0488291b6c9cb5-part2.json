Learn with Trailhead.\n\nHealthcare Payer Solution Architecture with Key Clouds\n\nThe Salesforce healthcare payer architecture runs on three highly scalable and interoperable platforms: the core Salesforce Platform, Marketing Cloud, and Commerce Cloud.\n\nProducts built on the Salesforce Platform (1) include Health Cloud, Order Management System (OMS), Experience Cloud, Loyalty & Rebates Center, Asset Management and Field Service, CRM Analytics, Identity, and Privacy Center. These products all operate on the same logical platform and share a flexible, common, and interoperable healthcare data model.\n\nHealth Cloud (2) is a superset of Sales Cloud and Service Cloud features customized for healthcare organizations. Health Cloud integrates sales, service, and marketing capabilities to provide a consistent experience across financial services departments and channels.\nOrder Management System (OMS) is a Commerce Cloud product, but it runs natively on the core Salesforce Platform. APIs enable integration with other Salesforce and non-Salesforce platforms.\nCRM Analytics has direct connections to the Salesforce Platform and is best suited for Sales and Service analytics.\nCustomer 360 Identity features single sign-on (SSO) and authentication management to ensure that employees, customers, and partners sign on safely across all your applications and systems.\nCustomer 360 Privacy Center manages data retention and rights, and it actively manages consent to ensure compliance with global and local privacy and consent rules.\nThe Salesforce Platform can be used in several ways.\nAs an engagement layer\nAs a customer master\nAs an editable or non-editable certified copy of customer master data\nTo integrate with a third-party Master Data Management system\n\nSalesforce Marketing Cloud (3) is a powerful suite of communication and marketing automation tools designed for interoperability.\n\nDatorama offers deep marketing analytics.\nInteraction Studio provides real-time interaction management, personalization, and AI-drive recommendations.\nSocial Studio enables social monitoring and social media interaction management.\nJourney Builder stitches these tools together. It provides campaign management and delivers cross-channel, personalized experiences at every step of the customer lifecycle.\n\nData Cloud (4) is Salesforce’s enterprise-wide CDP solution. Data Cloud delivers a unified profile by bringing together customer source records, transactions, engagement activities, demographics, and signals from first or third-party data sources. It provides marketers a single source of truth for their customer and makes that data available for creating personalized experiences across every touchpoint.\n\nCommerce Platform (5) is a highly scalable platform for web and mobile ecommerce.\n\nAppExchange (6) is the leading enterprise cloud marketplace with over 4,000 solutions to help extend Salesforce into any department or industry. Over 1,000 consultants have deep expertise to drive business transformation.\n\nTableau (7) is a business intelligence platform and has direct connections to the rest of Salesforce. Tableau provides analytics independent of data sources.\n\nMulesoft Anypoint Platform (8) is an integration platform designed for service-oriented architecture (SOA), Software as a Service (SaaS), and APIs. Mule ESB, CloudHub iPaaS, API Manager, and hundreds of SaaS and on-premises connectors and templates are the building blocks of this unique connectivity platform for integration.\n\nUse APIs to connect applications, data, and devices, both on-premises and in the cloud.\nRearchitect a service-oriented architecture from legacy systems, proprietary platforms, and customer integration code.\nMigrate technology infrastructure to the public or private cloud, and prioritize adoption of SaaS applications and other cloud technologies.\nDeploy integrations in a hybrid environment, connecting to SaaS applications and on-premises systems.\nHealthcare Payer Solution Architecture with Connectors\n\nDeveloping point-to-point connections with API solutions allows customer experiences to cross Marketing, Service, and Commerce platform boundaries.\n\nAPI Integration (1) allows the Commerce platform to initiate actions in the Marketing platform.\n\nTrack page views, searches, product views, cart contents, and order placement.\nManage marketing opt-ins, email subscriptions, and preferences.\nTrigger transactional email, including account creation and update messages, password recovery, customer service messages, and order confirmation.\nTrigger behavioral emails, such as messages about abandoned carts, and browse and wishlist-related messaging using a combination of productized solutions and API integrations.\nSync data such as product catalogs, customer information, order details, and promotional details.\nThis connector is community code and provides a development framework for customers to follow.\n\nAPI Integration (2) integrates Commerce Cloud to Health Cloud. The integration allows for data synching between the two clouds to support several use cases.\n\nSubmit cases from anonymous or registered customers.\nRetrieve case details for a registered member from Health Cloud.\nSync profiles of registered customers and profile-specific addresses between Commerce and Health Clouds.\nA community-based solution exists to provide an enablement framework for developing this integration. For more information, contact your account team.\n\nPre-built Salesforce connectors enable the connectivity that allows the cross-cloud actions required to support sophisticated use cases. These types of use cases include delivering a follow-up email based on customer inquiry about their financial goals.\n\nMarketing Cloud Connect (3) connects Marketing platform products with Health Cloud products. The connector allows data to sync between clouds. It also allows Marketing Cloud products to trigger events such as emails and journeys based on Health Cloud data.\n\nAutomatically sync data from Health Cloud to Marketing Cloud.\nConnect Journey Builder to other clouds.\nUse Health Cloud data to construct email.\nProvide Marketing Cloud email tracking data such to Health Cloud products.\n\nDistributed Marketing (4) allows users in Health Cloud to view, personalize, and send on-brand, best practice content through Marketing Cloud.\n\nUse data stored in contact, lead, or person account records to address emails.\nCraft email to a segment of customers based on a list view.\nSend email about a campaign to a group of customers based on a touchpoint cadence managed by Marketing Cloud.\n\nSocial Customer Service (5) integrates Salesforce Platform functionality with Social Studio so agents and sales reps can respond to cases and leads created from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and other social networks.\n\nSEE ALSO\nSalesforce Architectural Diagrams: Quick Look\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
