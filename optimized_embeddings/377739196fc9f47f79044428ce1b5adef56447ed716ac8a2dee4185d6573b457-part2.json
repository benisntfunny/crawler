In Lightning Experience, duplicates are identified using matching rules, which are applied to individual records or duplicate jobs. In Salesforce Classic, duplicates are identified using matching rules or the following:\n\nLeads: The Find Duplicates button on lead records\nAccounts: The Merge Accounts button on the Accounts page\nContacts: The Merge Contacts button on the Related Contacts related list on account records\n\nIn Lightning Experience, merge duplicates that you can’t identify using matching rules and duplicate rules by adding duplicate record items to duplicate record sets. Then merge the items.\n\n\nContacts Associated with Portal Users\t\t\tWhen you use Lightning Experience to merge contacts associated with portal users, the portal user status isn’t shown during merging. The merged record retains the portal user status of the main record. When you use Salesforce Classic or the API to merge contacts associated with portal users, the portal user status is shown during merging. You choose the portal status you want to retain in the merged record.\nMerge Accounts Associated with Relationship Groups\t\t\tRelationship groups aren’t supported in Lightning Experience. Instead, after merging, relate records to accounts manually.\nSEE ALSO\nManage Duplicate Records\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
