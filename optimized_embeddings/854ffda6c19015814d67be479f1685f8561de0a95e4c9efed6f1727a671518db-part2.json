You can view Salesforce Order Management record pages on the mobile app, but you can’t access its console features, like screen flows.\n\nLearn More\nOrder Management Resources\nIn addition to Salesforce Help, Order Management has documentation resources to help you learn about, set up, administer, and extend the Order Management app.\nSalesforce Order Management Licenses and Allocations\nSalesforce Order Management (SOM) license allocations are based on either the anticipated gross merchandise volume (GMV) of the order summary record or the number of order summary records created. Order summary records can be either managed or unmanaged.\nPreconfigured Permission Sets for Salesforce Order Management\nUsers assigned to a preconfigured permission set receive permissions according to their persona’s required functionality. You can customize a permission set by cloning it and modifying the individual permissions.\nSalesforce Payments and Order Management\nFacilitate secure and convenient order processing with payment collection and refunds by integrating Salesforce Payments and Order Management. If your Payments merchant accounts are linked to a Stripe account, Order Management can capture payments and issue refunds. If your merchant accounts are linked to a PayPal account, Order Management can only issue refunds.\nOrder Management Lifecycle\nUse Order Management to automate and manage the order lifecycle from order capture through fulfillment and post-fulfillment service. You can also store data for orders that are managed outside of Order Management.\nOrder Management Objects\nOrder Management objects, together with existing objects, represent the elements of an order as the order progresses through the order lifecycle. The process for creating records in Order Management depends on your storefront. For example, if you use Salesforce B2C Commerce, the B2C Commerce Integration imports order data into Order Management. The terms “item” and “product” are used interchangeably throughout Order Management. Usually, technical areas like APIs and flow actions use “item,” while the user interface uses “product.”\nOrder Management Shopper and Buyer Records\nOrder Management uses the Account and Contact objects to represent business and individual shoppers. It can also use Person Accounts to represent individual shoppers. When it receives an order, it searches for the shopper. If it finds the shopper, it associates the order with the existing records. If it doesn’t find the shopper, it creates records for that shopper. B2B Commerce uses the term “buyer” instead of “shopper.” In Order Management, references to shoppers also apply to buyers.\nConfigure Order Management Flows\nOrder Management works with Salesforce Flow, which makes it easy for you to create manual and automated functions. We provide out-of-the-box flow templates for processes such as order summary creation, placing orders on behalf of shoppers, order fulfillment, and order servicing.\nEinstein Generative AI for Order Management\nEnhance your Order Management experience with Einstein generative AI, and deliver smarter service to your customers.\nHigh-Scale Orders\nHigh-scale orders can ingest orders from B2C Commerce and other order channels. It uses an internal data service called Zero Object Service (ZOS). ZOS acts as a buffer for storefront order data that would otherwise overwhelm Order Management processing. ZOS sends the data asynchronously to Order Management, which creates order summaries and processes the orders. High-scale orders is supported on Hyperforce and is only available with a Growth license.\nDeleting Order Management Records\nCertain situations require that you delete Order Management records. For example, some records can contain customer personal information and are subject to data protection and privacy regulations. To maintain data integrity, before you delete records consider their dependencies and access restrictions on some of their data.\nOrder Management Console\nThe Order Management Console shows all your order information at a glance. It includes tools that help you track, manage, and service orders throughout the order lifecycle.\nOrder Summary\nAn order summary pulls together all order details into a single, consolidated view. It can help you manage and service orders before, during, and after fulfillment.\nOrder Fulfillment\nThe order fulfillment process streamlines the allocation, assignment, picking, packing, and shipment of order items.\nDistributed Order Management\nOrder Management includes tools for distributing orders across your fulfillment network based on custom business logic. If you use Salesforce Omnichannel Inventory, you can also incorporate its availability features into your order routing process.\nPayments and Invoices\nThe authorization, capture, and reconciliation of payments occurs as orders move through stages in the fulfillment workflow. Your Salesforce admin can automate payment capture, invoice generation, and refund processing to help manage your payment transaction needs.\nProcess Exceptions\nYou can automate order processing across every stage in the order lifecycle. When your automated business logic encounters an issue that interrupts normal processing, a process exception occurs. Various issues can cause a process exception, such as a failed fraud check, a payment capture error, a lack of available inventory, or a problem with a shipping carrier.\nOrder Service Tasks\nOrder service tasks let your customer service representatives (CSR) provide shoppers with order-related service, such as returns, exchanges, and cancellations. Order Management uses flow templates to help automate the these tasks. Your Salesforce Admin can copy and customize these templates and then make the process flows available in the Actions & Recommendations section on the Order Summary page. Your service agents can then quickly respond to requests for cancellations, reshipments, discounts, exchanges, and returns.\nReports for Order Management\nUse reports to retrieve and analyze order, fulfillment, and payment information to help you optimize service delivery and keep your order workflow running smoothly.\nB2C Commerce Connections\nWhen you use a Salesforce B2C Commerce storefront, you can provision or deactivate integrated features, such as Omnichannel Inventory, Order Self-Service, Order Integration, and Cart and Checkout Data.\nTroubleshoot the B2C Commerce Integration\nIf the integration of B2C Commerce with Order Management isn’t working correctly, review these troubleshooting tips.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
