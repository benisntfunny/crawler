With the Education Cloud Student Success and Mentoring apps, you can model a variety of programs and track the allocation of benefits across the institution, helping you to more effectively meet learner requirements. You can even publish the programs that you offer on your learner portal, so learners can view details and self-enroll.\n\nIn Student Success and Mentoring, you can add an assessment with predefined questions to a program. The assessment questionnaire appears in the portal when a learner enrolls in the program. Automation saves the submitted responses as records related to the program enrollment. Advisors and mentorship facilitators can review the responses to clearly understand the learner's requirements and determine if the program meets their needs and how best to support them.\n\nAdvising and mentoring programs offer benefits where the category of the benefit type is advising or mentoring, respectively. When a learner enrolls in a program, they're automatically enrolled in the respective advising or mentoring benefit, and a benefit assignment record is created. Learners participating in advising programs can then schedule an appointment with an assigned success team member for the program, which automatically creates a benefit disbursement. The status of the benefit disbursement is updated based on the appointment. For a mentoring program, mentors can register as a provider of the benefit in the mentor portal Experience Cloud site. Mentoring facilitators can then use the assessments to connect a mentee with a mentor on the benefit assignment record.\n\nEducation Cloud includes these integration procedures, flows, and invocable actions that automate the processes in program enrollment.\n\nRESOURCE API NAME\tTYPE\tDESCRIPTION\nEDUProgramMgmt_EnrollInProgram\tIntegration Procedure\t\n\nEnrolls the learner in the support program and:\n\nCreates a program enrollment record.\nCreates a benefit assignment record.\nCreates a task for the learner to schedule an appointment with the advisor.\nNOTE To provide access to tasks, enable the Edit Tasks and Access Activities in the learner's profile permissions.\nCreates a case with related records if the program has a success team and no open case of the specific record type exists for the account.\nAssociates the assessment record with the program enrollment, if applicable.\n\ncreateBenefitDisbursementForServiceAppointment\tInvocable Action\tCreates a benefit disbursement record for every service appointment ID.\nCreateBnftDisbForAppt\tFlow\tInvokes the createBenefitDisbursementForServiceAppointment invocable action.\nUpdateBnftDisbByAppt\tFlow\tUpdates the status of the existing benefit disbursement, or creates a new one.\nBatchGenBenefitDisb\tFlow\tRuns daily batch jobs that invoke the CreateBnftDisbForAppt flow.\nCreateMentorEnrollmentRec\tFlow\tCreates a constituent role record of Mentor for benefit providers upon the creation of a benefit provider record.\nCreateMenteeEnrollmentRec\tFlow\tCreates a benefit assignment record and a constituent role record of Mentee for a contact upon the creation of a program enrollment record.\nShareMentoringRecords\tFlow\t\n\nShares records between the mentor and mentee for Experience Cloud site access.\n\nNOTE This flow automatically shares records. Internal Public Read access on Program Enrollment causes the flow to fail.\n\nCreaUpdtCtctCtctRelaRec\tFlow\tCreates or updates contact contact relationship records for benefit providers that represent the relationship between mentors and mentees.\nUpdateMentorCstnRoleRec\tFlow\tUpdates a constituent role record to inactive when the associated provider offering record is marked as inactive.\nDeactvMenteeCstnRoleRec\tFlow\tDeactivates the constituent role record for a mentee when the program enrollment ends.\nNOTE A program enrollment record can be created irrespective of the status of the program. We recommend that you implement restrictions as required in your org.\nIntelligent Question Generation\nIntake assessments help you understand the learner's requirements and determine how best to support them. Use Intelligent Question Generation with Einstein generative AI to easily draft questions for intake assessments.\nCreate an Intake Assessment for a Support Program\nCreate an Omni Process that shows assessment questions and captures responses when learners enroll in a program.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
