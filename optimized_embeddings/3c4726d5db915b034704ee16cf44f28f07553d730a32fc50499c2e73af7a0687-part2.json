Each DevOps Center project needs its own repository for storing project changes. While you’re working on the project, the repository is the team’s centralized source of truth to manage changes.\n(Optional) Seed a Source Control Repository with Org Metadata\nIf you’re currently using change sets to move changes to environments in your release pipeline, it’s likely that you don’t have a source control repository that contains your production org’s metadata. Although you can approach this task in any number of ways, this method uses the Salesforce (Developer Experience) DX tools that many of you are already familiar with. However, those of you who don’t have any experience using DX developer tools can easily follow along.\nAdd Team Members to Repo As Collaborators\nAdd team members as repository collaborators. In GitHub, a collaborator is someone who has been granted write access to the project repository. Add everyone who creates customizations or code for your project to the project repository as a collaborator. That way, they have access to the repository through DevOps Center.\nIf an Organization Owns the GitHub Repo\nGitHub repos owned by an organization aren’t visible in DevOps Center until an organization account owner provides access.\nIf the Organization Has an IP Allow List\nIf you have restricted access to the GitHub organization assets by configuring an allow list, add the IP addresses for the DevOps Center app.\n(Optional) Install Salesforce CLI DevOps Center Plugin (Beta)\nInstall the Salesforce CLI DevOps Center plugin to perform DevOps Center actions on the command line for developers who plan to work outside of DevOps Center or want to automate tasks. We plan to roll out new commands over time. The first set of commands support the ability to deploy changes to a pipeline environment and perform a validate-only deployment.\nConnect to a Different GitHub Account\nWhen creating or opening a project, all team members log in to GitHub using the account that has access to the repos that your team wants to use with DevOps Center. If you or a team member logged in with the incorrect GitHub account, a team member with Salesforce admin privileges can delete the authorization information so you or the team member can log in using the proper credentials.\nDetermine What Metadata Types to Ignore During Development\nYour Salesforce DX project repo contains a .forceignore file that determines what metadata and files to exclude when retrieving files from development environments and deploying changes to environments in your release pipeline.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
