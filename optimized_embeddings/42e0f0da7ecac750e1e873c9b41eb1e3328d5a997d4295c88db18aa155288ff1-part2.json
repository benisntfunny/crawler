Check out the cloud-specific alert pages linked below to learn more about individual Proactive Monitoring alert types. Visit the Proactive Monitoring on Salesforce Help knowledge article for more details about the portal experience.\n\n\nProactive Monitoring Overview\n\nIntroduction\n\nProactive Monitoring helps predict and prevent issues with 24/7 monitoring and early warnings, allowing customers to keep their business operations running smoothly. It is a feature of the Signature Success Plan, with coverage for Sales, Service, Experience Cloud, Platform, B2C Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud Engagement, Marketing Cloud Intelligence, and Tableau.\n\nProactive Monitoring tracks 50+ key implementation health metrics at the tenant level and provides early detection of issues like inefficiencies, application performance degradation, or errors with near-real-time notifications. When generating alerts, Proactive Monitoring provides tailored diagnostic detail, makes prescriptive recommendations, and automatically creates support cases to connect customers with support engineers for assistance.\n\nIn addition to its monitoring and detection tools, Proactive Monitoring is supplemented with a services offering. Proactive Services Engineers work with customers to establish their monitoring plan and manage their alert configuration to ensure optimal monitoring coverage. When a Proactive Monitoring Smart Alert is fired, Monitoring Technical Engineers will support customers with their cases.\n\nWith Proactive Monitoring, customers can:\n\nReceive real-time alerts about risks for implementation.\nReview metrics and diagnostic data tailored to their alerts.\nEngage with the Proactive Services team to resolve issues and optimize their implementation.\n\nWatch the Proactive Monitoring Overview video.\n\nWho to Contact About Proactive Monitoring\n\nIf you are a Signature Success Plan customer and have questions about Proactive Monitoring, please contact your Customer Success Manager.\n\n\nProactive Monitoring Smart Alerts\n\nWith Proactive Monitoring Smart Alerts, customers can predict and diagnose issues. They will be notified of any potential performance and scale limitations that could impact their business-critical solutions.\n\nEarlier notification of critical issues via Proactive Monitoring Smart Alerts means support teams can quickly swing into action, solve problems faster, and remediate issues before they impact business.\n\nCloud Coverage\n\nProactive Monitoring is available for the following clouds. Learn more about each cloud’s alerts and corresponding definitions:\n\n Sales, Service, Experience Cloud, and Platform\nMarketing Cloud Account Engagement\nMarketing Cloud Engagement\nMarketing Cloud Intelligence\nTableau Cloud\nB2C Commerce Cloud\n\nSmart Alert Content\n\nProactive Monitoring Smart Alerts contain the following content, which will vary by alert level:\n\nHigh-level information about the alert, including alert level, alert type, and the associated case ID (for Critical alerts only).\nMetrics data detailing the issue and the reason an alert was fired.\nDiagnostic data containing the top drivers behind the metric spike, such as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), user IDs, and requests.\nLinks to alert type-specific knowledge articles on Salesforce Help.\nFor Sales, Service, Experience Cloud, or Platform alerts, select the Analyze Trends button to go to Proactive Monitoring on Salesforce Help (authentication required) and auto-populate relevant tenants, time ranges, and metrics.\n\n\n\nSmart Alert Types and Case Creation\n\nFor most Proactive Monitoring metrics, an alert is fired when the given metric breaches and holds above a specified threshold for a specific duration for a given tenant. These thresholds can be:\nWarning level which indicates a potential risk to implementation health that should be reviewed.\nCritical level which indicates an urgent change in health metrics that should be actioned and remediated as soon as possible.\nLimit-based alerts that have an additional Exhaust level threshold fixed at 99% of a limit. This indicates that the metric has breached the limit and impact to the tenant is highly likely.\nSome metrics will fire alerts based on anomalies rather than threshold or duration to ensure alerts are as proactive as possible while reducing noise.\n\nA support case is automatically generated when a Proactive Monitoring metric triggers a Critical level or Exhaust level alert. Salesforce Support will then review and troubleshoot the issue. While the case remains open, no new cases will be created for the given metric until the existing case is closed. For Warning level alerts, a case is not automatically generated, but users can create a support case from Salesforce Help.\n\nSmart Alert Configuration\n\nProactive Monitoring Smart Alerts have logic configured at the tenant level to cater to a customer’s implementation needs by ensuring that alert coverage is optimized and noise is minimized. The Proactive Services Engineering team will work directly with a customer to review and adjust alert thresholds and duration values periodically or as needed.\n\nIf a customer has a question or a request related to their Proactive Monitoring configuration, they should contact their Customer Success Manager.\nProactive Monitoring on Salesforce Help\n\nThe Proactive Monitoring tab on Salesforce Help provides customers with on-demand analysis of performance metric trends and a view into alert configuration. It is available to Signature Success Plan customers with Sales, Service, Experience Cloud, or Platform.\n\nWith Proactive Monitoring on Salesforce Help, customers can:\nGain a clearer view of their Technical Health with easy-access diagnostic data, helping them determine the best steps to improve their system performance.\nSpeed up problem-solving to diagnose and resolve issues quickly with a centralized view.\nTrack health trends and build custom dashboards to visualize performance and scale metrics for Salesforce implementations.\n\n\nAccess Proactive Monitoring on Salesforce Help.\n\nVisit the Proactive Monitoring on Salesforce Help knowledge article for a detailed walkthrough of the experience and FAQs.\n\nWatch the demo video to learn more about Proactive Monitoring on Help.\n\n\nWhat’s New?\n\nJune 2024 Release Updates\n\nSmart Alerting\n\nThe Proactive Monitoring Smart Alert experience includes a new rich-text based email format that highlights alert specifics, improving readability and making it easier to take action.\n\nProactive support cases will now only be created for Critical and Exhaust alerts. Critical alerts indicate an urgent change in health metrics and Exhaust alerts indicate the metric being monitored has breached the limit.\n\nThese changes may prompt a need for customers to update downstream processes to ensure operations are not affected.
