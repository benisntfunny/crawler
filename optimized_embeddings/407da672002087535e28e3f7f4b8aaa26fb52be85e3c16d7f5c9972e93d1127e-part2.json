See Available Languages. Salesforce offers three levels of language support: fully supported languages, end-user languages, and platform-only languages. For more information, see Supported Languages.\nDo you localize product documentation?\nWe currently localize documentation for these products: Accounting Subledger, Accounting Subledger Legacy, Case Management, Education Cloud, Education Data Architecture (EDA), Grants Management, Insights Platform Data Integrity, Marketing Cloud Engagement for Industries, Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP), Outbound Funds Module, Program Management Module (PMM), and Student Success Hub (SSH). See Available Languages for details. See Localized Documentation for a list of links to documentation.\nI noticed a mistake or something missing from a translation. Where do I report it?\nKeep in mind that we update translations only for major releases, so they can be out of sync after minor releases. To report a mistake, create a case with the Topic set to Setup and Security, and the Category set to Globalization and Localization.\nCan I override translations?\nAbsolutely. You can use the Translation Workbench to override translations. To learn more, see Translation Workbench.\nWhat's the difference between language and locale?\nIn Salesforce, you'll see both Language and Locale settings. Locale determines the display formats for date and time, addresses, phone numbers, and commas and periods in numbers. Language determines the language that objects, fields, settings, and user interface text appear in.\nDo you accept translations from the community?\nEven though many of our products are open source, we don't currently accept GitHub pull requests for localization contributions. The localization process requires a level of maintenance that's not realistic or sustainable for community contributors, and we therefore rely on our own localization programs to deliver high-quality, timely translations.\nAvailable Languages\n\nSee the list of languages for which your Marketing Could Engagement for Industries product is available.\n\nSalesforce.org provides translations into these languages. When you choose one of the supported languages during user (or org-wide) setup, Insights_Platform objects, fields, settings, and user interface text appear in that language.\n\nInsights Platform\nNOTE These languages apply to the Data Integrity package only.\nLANGUAGE\tUI\tDOCUMENTATION\nDutch\t√\t√\nEnglish (UK)\t√\t√\nFrench\t√\t√\nGerman\t√\t√\nPortuguese (Brazil)\t√\t√\nLocalized Documentation\n\nGet links to documentation in other languages.\n\nUse these links to access the localized documentation for each available language.\n\nInsights Platform\nDutch\nEnglish (UK)\nFrench\nGerman\nPortuguese (Brazil)\nEnable Languages\n\nEnable localization in Salesforce for your Marketing Cloud Engagement for Industries cloud product.\n\nWe recommend that you complete these steps to enable a language for use in Insights Platform :\n\nBefore using any translated languages, enable Translation Workbench in Setup. For information, see Enable and Disable the Translation Workbench.\n\nIf you're enabling a platform-only language:\n\nFrom Setup, search for and then select Enable platform-only languages.\nMove the desired language to the Displayed Languages list.\nSave your changes.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
