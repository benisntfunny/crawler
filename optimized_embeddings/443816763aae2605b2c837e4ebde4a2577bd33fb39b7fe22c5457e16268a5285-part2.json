Complete the requirements for each program item and check your progress.\n\nExercise Progress\n\nSome exercises open content in a new browser tab, and some exercises show content on the same tab you’re on.\n\nMost exercises are considered complete after you follow the link, watch the video, or finish the lesson. Some exercise types have unique requirements.\n\nFor an Action Item exercise in a sales program in Lightning Experience, click Mark as Complete after you finish the offline activity.\nFor a Feedback Request exercise in a sales program in Lightning Experience, specify the URL to content that you want peers, managers, and other leaders to leave feedback on.

If you don’t want to wait, you can also click Refresh Progress when taking the program. To view your progress on an outcome or milestone, click its title. You can see your overall progress percentage on a progress bar and individual records that contribute to your progress in a qualifying records table. To view the details of a qualifying record, click it.\n\nNOTE You can’t view the details of a qualifying record if the milestone or outcome is built to measure a virtual Salesforce entity.\n\nTo see your progress toward goals that are measured in averages, you must meet the required record count.\n\nIn some programs, multiple milestones require you to complete the same action, or the outcome and incremental milestones require you to complete the same action. When you progress toward one milestone, that progress counts toward other milestones that require the same action.\n\nIf you miss the due date of the outcome or a milestone, you can still complete the requirements, but the outcome or milestone’s status is Behind. If you don’t complete the outcome or milestone 30 days after the program’s due date has passed, the outcome’s or milestone’s status is no longer tracked. At that point, it’s no longer possible to complete all items in the program. If the outcome or milestone requires you to complete a voice or video call recorded with Einstein Conversation Insights, progress isn’t tracked after the outcome’s or milestone’s due date has passed.\n\nProgram Progress\n\nFor sales programs in Lightning Experience, the progress bar shows your progress through the program. Program status completion is computed twice per day—5 AM and 8 PM—according to the time zone set in Salesforce.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
