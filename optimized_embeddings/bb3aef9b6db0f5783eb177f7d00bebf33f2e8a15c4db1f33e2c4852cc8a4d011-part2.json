Heroku is another service offered by Salesforce on a separate infrastructure. The Change Management Hub may also use further downstream processors, including third parties. Tell me more about Heroku.\nAllow these IP addresses for your organization so admins can complete tasks in the hub that require access to Salesforce.\n52.2.2.209\n52.203.195.34\n52.200.207.131\n52.72.119.132\nSEE ALSO\nVideo: Manage Change for a Successful Transition\nLightning Experience Enablement Pack\nSet Trusted IP Ranges for Your Organization\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
