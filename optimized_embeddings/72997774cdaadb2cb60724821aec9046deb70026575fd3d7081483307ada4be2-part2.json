A campaign can be as simple or as complex as you need, from sending a simple email to building out an automated, multistep customer experience.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\nCreating Campaigns\n\nWhen you create a campaign, you select a preconfigured flow to start with. You can add more flows to your campaign from the campaign record. There are two types of campaign flows: segment-triggered and form-triggered. Segment-triggered flows send content based on segment membership, and form-triggered flows automate actions or tasks when someone submits a form.\n\nOPTION\tFLOW TYPE\tDETAILS\nSingle Email with Einstein\tSegment-triggered\tIncludes a single email, an email brief, and a segment built with generative AI. Einstein helps you draft content and generates a draft segment that you can review and edit.\nSingle Email\tSegment-triggered\tIncludes a preconfigured email. Edit and publish the email, set a schedule, and activate the flow from the campaign record.\nMessage Series\tSegment-triggered\tIncludes 2 preconfigured emails. From the campaign record, select a segment and edit and publish each email to meet your needs. Then, go into Flow Builder to schedule your emails and activate the flow to begin sending.\nSignup Form\tForm-triggered\tIncludes a customizable form and landing page, and two flow actions to create leads and capture consent for marketing messages. In Flow Builder, configure the Consent Record action. Then, edit and publish your content to activate the flow.\nBlank Email\tSegment-triggered\tFill in the campaign details. Then when you’re ready, create an email or choose an existing one.\nNavigating the Campaign Record\n\nAll campaigns include basic information about their related flows. Every flow has a Start Trigger section (1) that summarizes the trigger for the flow, either a form or a segment. From the Content section (2), you can preview or edit each piece of content related to your campaign. From the sidebar on a campaign record, you can add a campaign brief, see campaign details, access related lists, and manage campaign members (3). You can also add new flows to your campaign (4).\n\nSegment-triggered flows with only a single message also include a Schedule section. You can send your message immediately, or schedule it to send later.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
