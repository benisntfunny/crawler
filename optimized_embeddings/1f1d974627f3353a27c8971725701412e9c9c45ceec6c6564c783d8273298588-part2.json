An element represents an action that the flow can perform. Flows process elements from top to bottom. You can add, move, and remove elements on the campaign flow canvas. To open an element’s panel and configure its details, click the element on the canvas.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create and edit flows:\t\n\nMarketing Cloud Manager permission set\n\nOR\n\nView Flows and Create and Edit Flows user permissions\n\nAND\n\nPermissions to all elements in the flow\n\nLearn more about Marketing Cloud Growth Permissions\n\nNOTE Flows with exit conditions or data graph data can't also have Update Records, Delete Records, or Subflow elements.\nTo add an element between two elements, hover over the circle and click +.\nSelect an element from the list.\nIn the panel, add a label and any other required information.\nTo move one element:\nClick the element you want to move.\nSelect Cut Element.\nIn the new location, hover over the circle between two elements and click the plus sign that appears.\nThe element appears in that location.\nTo copy and paste one element:\nClick the element you want to copy.\nSelect Copy Element.\nIn the new location, hover over the circle between two elements and click the plus sign that appears. Then select Paste 1 Element.\nTo copy and paste multiple elements:\nClick Select Elements on the button bar.\nClick the plus sign for each element you want to copy.\nClick the clipboard icon on the button bar.\nIn the new location, hover over the circle between two elements and click the plus sign that appears. Then select Paste Elements.\nTo delete an element, click the element, and then select Delete Element.\nBranch a Campaign Flow Path\n\nThe Decision element creates a branch in your flow, similar to an IF/ELSE statement in code. You configure one or more outcome paths, and any remaining records follow the default outcome path.\n\nREQUIRED USER PERMISSIONS\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo add a decision element to a flow:\tAdd Decision Element to Flows\n\nTo select record fields in a decision outcome, first select a segment in the Start element. Decision outcomes are evaluated in the order they appear in the outcome list.\n\nOn the flow canvas, add a Decision element.\nGive the element an internal name.\nConfigure outcome conditions for each flow path.\nTo add another outcome and flow path, click the plus sign icon in the Outcome Order section.\nTo change the order in which outcomes are evaluated, drag outcomes to arrange them.\nEXAMPLE\n\nUrsa Major Solar hosts an event at their industry convention. Account rep Lincoln wants to send a welcome email to people whose contact records were created after the conference and a conference recap email to remaining contacts. In a message series campaign flow, he adds a decision element at the beginning of the flow canvas.\n\nThen, he configures the Decision element.\n\nHe labels the Decision element New Conference Contact? and the first outcome Yes.\nFor Condition Requirement to Execute Outcome, he selects All Conditions are Met (AND).\nFor the Resource he selects $Record > ssot__Created Date__c.\nFor the Operator, he selects Greater Than or Equal to and gives the Value the start date and time of the conference.\nFor the default outcome, Lincoln changes the name to No, so that it’s clear on the canvas which path is which.\n\nThen, he adds a Send Email Message element to each path, and selects the right message for each one. New contacts receive the welcome email and remaining contacts on the default outcome path receive an email with a recap of the conference. Lincoln notices an extra Wait element on the canvas, but he doesn't need it. He deletes the Wait element, and activates the flow.\n\nWhen someone in the flow meets the condition for an outcome, they take that path. If an individual meets multiple outcome conditions, the flow takes the first one listed. If no outcome conditions are met, the flow follows the default outcome path.\n\nCreate a Rule to Remove a User from a Flow\n\nExit rules enable you to remove a user from a flow as soon as the user isn’t relevant to the flow. For example, you can create a rule that sends a user to the end of a flow if the user changes job roles. You can add up to ten exit rules to a flow. An exit rule contains conditions that act like filters to remove users. Conditions are based on global attributes of the flow or Data Cloud data graph attributes, related attributes, or calculated insights.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo create and edit flows:\t\n\nMarketing Cloud Manager permission set\n\nOR\n\nView Flows and Create and Edit Flows user permissions\n\nAND\n\nPermissions to all elements in the flow\n\nLearn more about Marketing Cloud Growth Permissions\n\nOpen a flow for editing.\nFrom a single email campaign, click the action menu, and then select Edit Flow.\nFrom other campaigns, click Edit Flow.\nFrom the Flows tab, click a row action menu, and then select View Flow.\nIn the Start node, click Edit next to the count of exit rules.\nIn the Exit Rules pane, click Add Exit Rule\nConfigure the exit rule.\nLabel—User-friendly name for the exit rule.\nAPI Name—Unique name for the exit rule without any spaces. API names must be unique in a flow.\nEnd Flow for User When—Option that determines whether any or all conditions must be met to apply the exit rule.\nConfigure the first condition of the exit rule.\nResource—Attribute that the flow checks to determine whether the user meets the condition.\nOperator—Operator for the condition expression.\nValue—Value to check for in the selected resource.\nTo add more conditions to the exit rule, click Add Condition.\nTo add more exit rules, click Add Exit Rule.\nSave your work.\nFlow Builder Elements for Marketing\n\nIn Marketing Cloud Growth, campaign flows are configured with one or more elements to get you started. To create more robust customer journeys, you can edit the flow and add elements that are available for campaign flows.\n\nELEMENT\tDESCRIPTION\tIN SEGMENT-TRIGGERED FLOWS\tIN FORM-TRIGGERED FLOWS\nAssignment\tAn Assignment element sets values in variables, collection variables, record variables, record collection variables, and global variables.\t\t\nAll Wait Elements\tWait elements pause the flow when wait conditions are met, such as a date and time, a length of time, or an event.\t\t\nCollection Filter\tA Collection Filter element applies criteria to a collection, and then outputs a new collection that contains only the items that meet the criteria.\t\t\nCollection Sort\tA Collection Sort element reorders the items within a collection and optionally limits the number of items that remain in the collection after the sort.\t\t\nDecision\tA Decision element is like an IF/ELSE statement. It evaluates a set of conditions and routes individuals to paths based on the outcome of those conditions. \t\t\nCreate Records\tA Create Records element creates one or more records in your Salesforce org.\t\t\nGet Records\tA Get Records element finds Salesforce records that meet filter conditions, and store values from the records in variables.\t\t\nUpdate Records\tAn Update Records element creates one or more records in your Salesforce org.\t\t\nLoop\tA Loop element starts a loop path for iterating over items in a collection variable.\t\t\nSend Email Message\tA Send Email Message element sends an email message to segment members based on conditions defined in the flow.\t\t\nSend SMS Message\tA Send SMS Message element sends an SMS message to segment members based on conditions defined in the flow.\t\t\nDelete Records\tA Delete Records element permanently deletes Salesforce records in your org.\t\t\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
