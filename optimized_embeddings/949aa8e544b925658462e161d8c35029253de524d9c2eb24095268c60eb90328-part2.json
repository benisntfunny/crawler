You can’t restrict access below your organization-wide default levels.\nTo create sharing rules, your organization-wide defaults must be Public Read Only or Private.\nIf multiple sharing rules give a user different levels of access to a record, the user gets the most permissive access level.\nSharing rules automatically grant additional access to related records. For example, opportunity sharing rules give role or group members access to the account associated with the shared opportunity. Contact and case sharing rules also provide the role or group members with access to the associated account.\nUsers in the role hierarchy are automatically granted the same access that users below them in the hierarchy have from a sharing rule provided that the object is a standard object or the Grant Access Using Hierarchies option is selected.\nUsers who don’t have licenses that support roles can only be included in some types of sharing rules, to receive access and to have records that they own shared. High-volume community or site users, Chatter External, and Chatter Free users can't be included in owner-based sharing rules. You can share records owned by high-volume users in guest user or criteria-based sharing rules.\nIf you share records owned by a queue in an owner-based sharing rule, only records owned by the queue are shared. Records owned by individual members of the queue aren’t shared.\nUsing blank values in criteria-based sharing rule conditions with equal and not equal operators is not recommended.\nAvailability\nAccount, campaign, case, contact, lead, opportunity, and custom object sharing rules are available for Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\nOnly account, asset, campaign, and contact sharing rules are available in Professional Edition.\nOnly custom object sharing rules are available in Database.com\nCriteria-based sharing rules aren’t available for all objects.\nYour org can have other objects that are available for sharing rules. To see which sharing rules are available, see the Sharing Settings setup page.\nFor Product2, you can create only guest user sharing rules. Criteria-based and owner-based sharing rules aren’t available.\nUpdating\nCreating an owner-based sharing rule with the same source and target groups as an existing rule overwrites the existing rule.\nAfter a sharing rule is saved, you can’t change the Share with field settings when you edit the sharing rule.\nSharing rules apply to all new and existing records that meet the definition of the source dataset.\nSharing rules apply to active and inactive users.\nWhen you change the access levels for a sharing rule, all records are automatically updated to reflect the new access levels.\nWhen you delete a sharing rule, the sharing access created by that rule is removed.\nWhen you modify which users are in a group, role, or territory, the sharing rules are reevaluated to add or remove access as necessary.\nWhen you transfer records from one user to another, the sharing rules are reevaluated to add or remove access to the transferred records as necessary.\nChanging sharing rules can require changing a large number of records at once. If your request is queued to process these changes efficiently, you receive an email notification when the process has been completed.\nLead sharing rules don’t automatically grant access to lead information after leads are converted into account, contact, and opportunity records.\nCriteria-Based Sharing Rules\nUsers who can’t have an assigned role can be included in criteria-based sharing rules that were created after the Spring `22 release. To include these users in criteria-based sharing rules that were created before Spring `22, delete the rule and select Include records owned by users who can't have an assigned role when you recreate it. These users can’t be included in other types of sharing rules.\nIn criteria-based sharing rules, you can’t use lookup fields, encrypted fields, formula fields, or fields whose values are derived from other fields on the record.\nFor rules that reference record types as criteria, the label is used, not the developer name. To avoid issues, make sure the record type’s label and its translations are unique.\nUsing blank values in criteria-based sharing rule conditions with equal and not equal operators isn't recommended.\nSite and Portal Users\nYou can create rules to share records between most types of site or portal and Salesforce users. And you can create sharing rules between site or portal users from different accounts as long as their license type supports roles. But you can’t include high-volume community or site users in owner-based sharing rules because they don’t have roles and can’t be in public groups. You can share records owned by high-volume users in guest user or criteria-based sharing rules.\nIn Salesforce orgs created before February 8, 2024, after enabling digital experiences, existing sharing rules automatically extend access to external users. This change occurs because sharing rules that grant access to Roles and Subordinates are converted to grant access to Roles, Internal and Portal Subordinates instead. To ensure that external users can't access records or folders containing sensitive data, update your sharing rules.\nYou can easily convert sharing rules that include Roles, Internal, and Portal Subordinates to include Roles and Internal Subordinates instead by using the Convert External User Access Wizard on the Digital Experiences Settings Setup page. You can use this wizard to convert any publicly accessible report, dashboard, and document folders to folders that are accessible by all users except for external users. For more information, see Considerations for the Convert External User Access Wizard.\nYou can only use guest user sharing rules to share records with unauthenticated guest users.\nFor more information on using sharing rules in Experience Cloud sites, check out this video.\n\nManaged Package Fields If a criteria-based sharing rule references a field from a licensed managed package whose license has expired, (expired) is appended to the label of the field. The field label appears in the field dropdown list on the rule’s definition page in Setup. Criteria-based sharing rules that reference expired fields aren't recalculated, and new records aren't shared based on those rules. But the sharing of existing records before the package's expiration is preserved.\nSEE ALSO\nSharing Rules\nConsiderations for the Convert External User Access Wizard\nSharing Rules for Communities\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
