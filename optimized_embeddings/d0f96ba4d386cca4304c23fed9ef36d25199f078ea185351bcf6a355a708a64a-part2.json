A PRM add-on license is required for each partner user.\nROLE\tRESPONSIBILITIES\nVendors\tYour company and its representatives are known collectively as a vendor of the goods or services that you provide.\nPartners\t\n\nIndividuals who don’t work for your company, but with whom your company collaborates with to achieve business goals. You can collaborate and communicate with partners by building a partner site using Experience Cloud and adopting the PRM for Slack app.\n\nThrough these interfaces, partners can track opportunities, get lead and fund approvals, learn insights into deal progress, coordinate marketing campaigns, and manage customer service cases.\n\n\nChannel managers\t\n\nAlso known as channel account managers. The person or persons at your company who work directly with partners and manages the channels in which partners interact.\n\nChannel managers monitor deal progress, create partner incentives, and coordinate partner enablement.

Salesforce admins also assign user roles to the channel managers, create partner accounts, and determine record security levels.\n\nSalesforce admins introduce features that help channel managers oversee partner activity and performance, such as productivity metrics.\n\nSalesforce admins also enable products and features in Salesforce that help partners be more productive in partner sites, such as sales, service, and marketing features.\n\n\nSite developer\t\n\nThe person who uses Digital Experiences to build the Experience Cloud sites where partners complete their daily tasks.

Enterprise Grid admins manage permissions and settings for the Slack Enterprise Grid licensed workspaces.\n\nSometimes, the Slack admin, Enterprise Grid admin, and Salesforce admin are the same person.\n\n\nEnablement team\tThe people at your company who design and run enablement programs. Channel managers should collaborate with this team if you are using Partner Enablement.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
