An action plan template defines the tasks and document checklist items needed to complete a business process.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Automotive Cloud, Consumer Goods Cloud, Education Cloud, Financial Services Cloud, Government Cloud with Lightning Scheduler, Health Cloud, Manufacturing Cloud, Nonprofit Cloud, and Public Sector Solutions. View edition availability.\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS NEEDED\nTo configure Action Plans:\t\n\nAction Plans permission set\n\nOR\n\nModify All Data\n\nNeed a refresher on the difference between an action plan template and an action plan?\n\nAn action plan template captures the repeatable tasks involved in a specific type of engagement. You set up the action plan template once, and update it as your understanding of the repeatable tasks refines over time.\nAn action plan is a run-time instance of the template that allows you to automate the sequence of the tasks you defined in the template. You generate an action plan from the template for each engagement. You can create multiple action plans from an action plan template.\n\nTo create a template:\n\nFrom the App Launcher, find and select Action Plan Templates, and then click New.\nCreate an action plan template.\nEnter a name and a description for the action plan template.\nSelect the template owner.\nSelect a Target Object.\nSelect the Action Plan Type as Industries.\nSave your changes.\nIn the Items tab:\nTo create a task, click New Task.\nTo create a document checklist item, click New Document Checklist Item.\nNOTE You can create multiple tasks and document checklist items.\nClick Publish Template.\nAdd Tasks to Action Plan Templates\nAdd tasks that are commonly done together in a single action plan template.\nAdd Task Dependencies to Action Plans\nEnsure that all tasks in an action plan are current and actionable by defining the prerequisite tasks that must be done prior to the successor tasks.\nAssign Action Plan Tasks to Roles\nSet up account, case, or opportunity teams to let users assign an action plan task to a role rather than a specific person.\nAssign Action Plan Tasks to Queues\nSet up queues to let action plan template creators assign tasks to queues. When an action plan is generated from the template, any user that’s a member of the queue can take ownership of the assigned task.\nConsiderations for Creating Action Plan Templates\nBefore you create action plan templates, review these considerations.\nInclude More Fields in Action Plan Template Tasks\nWhen creating tasks for action plan templates, you can capture more data for the tasks by including up to eight additional standard and custom fields in addition to the default fields, such as subject, priority, days, and comments.\nFilter Action Plan Templates by Status\nIn the action plan templates list view, use the filter options to filter by status.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
