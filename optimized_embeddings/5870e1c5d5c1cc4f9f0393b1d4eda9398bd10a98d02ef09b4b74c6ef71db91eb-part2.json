Then use Portability API to compile the PII into a secure file that you can repackage and deliver to your customer. View the history and status of all requests in the Portability Log.\n\nAlternatively, use the Privacy Request object to manage data requests. Build triggers and flows to receive and execute requests, and then share the results of the request response with the data subject. Incorporate the Privacy Request object into your reports and dashboards to gain insight into the data subject access requests that your org receives. For more information, see Privacy Request.\n\nCreate a Portability Policy\nThe policy detects and displays any default and custom objects connected to the Account, Contact, Individual, Lead, Person, or User objects. And you can select individual fields on an object that represent a customer’s personally identifiable information (PII).\nMonitor Data Subject Access Request Fulfillment with the Portability Log\nMake sure that you fulfill every customer request in Salesforce to access personal data in accordance with data compliance law. Use the Portability Log in Privacy Center to see a history of your executed portability policies. You can also access the files generated by Portability API to repackage and deliver the requested customer data.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
