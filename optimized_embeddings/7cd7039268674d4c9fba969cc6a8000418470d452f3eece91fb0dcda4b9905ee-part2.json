By default, anyone who can see a file can share it.\n\nTo share a file with one or more users in your company:\n\nStart by sharing the file from one of these locations:\nOn the detail page of the file you want to share, click  File Sharing Settings | Share with people. Or click Sharing Settings, and then click People in the Sharing Settings dialog box.\nNext to the file in a feed, click More Actions | File Sharing Settings, and then click People in the Sharing Settings dialog box.\nNext to the file on the Files home page, click Share with people.\nOn a file hover, click  Share File and then click People in the Sharing Settings dialog box.\nEnter the name of the person who you want to share the file with, and then select a file by clicking its name.\nChoose the file permission you want your audience to have. By default, they have collaborator permission, which lets them view, download, share, change permission, edit the file, and upload new versions. Give them permission to view, download, and share files by selecting Viewer.\nTo share the file with more people, enter more names.\nOptionally, add information to the message that recipients receive.\nClick Share and Close. Recipients receive a link to the file and a message that you have shared the file with them. Lightning Experience users receive this message as an email notification. Salesforce Classic users get a private Chatter message on their My Messages page on the Chatter tab. If Classic users have email notifications for Chatter messages enabled, they also get an email notification .\n\nUnless the file’s already shared with your company, it's privately shared and displays the privately shared icon (). It's not posted anywhere, and only the people who you specifically shared it with can find and view it. If it’s already shared with your company, it retains the “your company” icon () and anyone in your company can find and view it.\n\nTo stop sharing the file with a person or a group, in the Sharing Settings dialog box, click  next to the person or group's name. If you don’t want others to change who can access the file, select Prevent others from sharing and unsharing.\n\nNOTE\nThere is no share button or option on the file detail page on an Experience Cloud site or in an internal org, if the file originated from the site.\nDocuments from the Documents tab and attachments from the Notes and Attachments related list aren't listed on Files home. And they can't be shared as Salesforce Files.\nIf content files are part of a content pack or delivery, they can be shared with more people than shown in Share with People.\nA file can be shared a maximum of 2000 times. This count includes shares with records, people, and groups. If a file is approaching the maximum number of shares, consider creating a public link or making the file public by posting it to your feed.\nSEE ALSO\nView Where a File Is Shared\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
