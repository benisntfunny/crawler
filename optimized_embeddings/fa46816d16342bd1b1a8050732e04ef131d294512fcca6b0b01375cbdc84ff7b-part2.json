Control access to the file with a password, or set the link to expire.\n\nAvailable in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Enterprise, Professional, Performance, Unlimited, Contact Manager, and Developer Editions\n\nWhen you create a public link to a file, anyone who has the link can view and download the file. File link recipients can only view and download file—they can't be collaborators. When you share single files, you have the option to set a password and an expiration date. After you delete a link, it no longer provides access to the file. If you create another link, it creates a new URL.\n\nCreate a File Link in Lightning Experience\n\nTo share a link to a single file\n\nFrom Files home or a files related list on a record, right-click a file and choose Public Link.\nFrom Chatter, right-click the file thumbnail in the feed and choose Public Link.\nFrom the file, right-click and click Share. From the Sharing dialog, create a link in the Who Can Access section under Public Link Sharing.\n\nUse the toggles to set an expiration date or password. Expiration dates are on by default and set 90 days in the future You can adjust the date or disable the toggle. Turn on the password toggle to generate a password, which displays on your screen.\n\nClick Create link, and then copy the link.\n\nCreate and Share a Public Link for a Folder in Lightning Experience\n\nYou can create public links to share folders to give people inside or outside your company access to a set of files. The public link is an encrypted URL. From the Library folder’s row-level actions click Public Link | Copy Link. To delete the link, click Public Link | trash can.\n\nCreate and Share a File Link in Salesforce Classic\nStart by sharing the file from one of these locations:\nOn Files home, click Upload files, select a file, then click Sharing Settingsand choose Anyone with Link. Copy the link and share it with people inside or outside your company.\nOn the Home page, click Create New | File, click Choose File, select a file, and then select Share via link from the dropdown menu.\nOn a file detail page, click  File Sharing Settings | Via link.\nIn the Sharing Settings dialog box, click Anyone with link from the Share with list.\nNext to the file on the Files page, the Files Owned by list, or the Group Files list, click  | Share via link.\nNext to the file in a feed or on a file hover, click More Actions | File Sharing Settings, then click Anyone with link from the Share with list.\nClick Copy if available (or copy the link manually), and paste the link into an email or IM. File link recipients can only view and download files. They can't be collaborators.\n\nUnless the file’s already shared with your company, it's privately shared and displays the privately shared icon (). It's not posted anywhere, and only the people who you specifically shared it with can find and view it. If it’s already shared with your company, it retains the “your company” icon () and anyone in your company can find and view it.\n\nTo stop sharing a file by link, in the Sharing Settings dialog box, click  next to the link. Anyone with the link can no longer access the file.\n\nNOTE\nDocuments from the Documents tab and attachments from the Notes and Attachments related list can't be shared as Salesforce Files.\nA file can be shared a maximum of 2000 times. This count includes shares with records, people, and groups. If a file is approaching the maximum number of shares, consider creating a public link or making the file public by posting it to your feed.\nSEE ALSO\nCreate Content Deliveries\nShare Files with People in Lightning Experience\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
