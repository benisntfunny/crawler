You can document reviews in your internal knowledge base.\nStart with a single category of articles, like frequently asked questions, and scale as you go. You can always add extra categories.\nMine the content you already have, such as webinars, slide decks, and one-pagers. Turn that content into articles.\nCustomize your Opportunity Stages\n\nClosing a deal or earning revenue takes a series of business milestones to achieve. Steps might include a discovery session to determine the customer’s needs, a presentation on how your product or service can benefit the customer, delivery of the business contract, and contract negotiations. Create custom opportunity stages to tailor the pipeline to your unique use case.\n\nMake a Few Decisions\n\nWhat is my sales process from start to finish?\nWhat are the business milestones I want to monitor?\n\nBest Practices to Consider\n\nA stage is a business milestone. A task is a step you take to achieve the milestone. For example, a stage is when you make a discovery call to find out a customer’s needs. A task for that stage is to schedule the call.\nUse path guidance to add up to 1,000 characters of instruction on how to successfully achieve an opportunity stage.\nSEE ALSO\nSet Up the Lightning Experience Home Page\nCreate or Clone a List View in Lightning Experience\nCustomize Fields\nReports and Dashboards\nEssentials Reporting and Dashboards Workshop\nGive Customers Access to Your Knowledge Base Through Help Center\nGuide Users with Path\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
