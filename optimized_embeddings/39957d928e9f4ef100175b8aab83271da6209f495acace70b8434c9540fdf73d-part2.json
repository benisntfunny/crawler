The Vlocity Health data model is designed to work seamlessly with Salesforce Health Cloud.\n\nEach ERD illustrates the important entities, relationships and the Vlocity extensions to the Salesforce object model. For a list of all the data, system and integration objects for the Vlocity Health data model, see the object list below. To understand the notation used in these diagrams, see About Vlocity Entity Relationship Diagram Notation.\n\nNOTE\n\nSalesforce provides industry-specific data models, built on top of the Salesforce object model, for each of the industries served by Salesforce. The logical entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) provided in this section illustrate the important entities and relationships for a given topic.\n\nThe ERDs illustrate how Salesforce extends the standard Salesforce object model to tailor it to the needs of each industry. Salesforce will, on request, provide a physical copy of a Salesforce Industry Data Model Blueprint to customers and partners. This industry-specific 2 x 3-feet logical ERD diagram documents the Salesforce data model for all the key business entities in a given industry.\n\nTo receive a copy, you'll need to sign an NDA Acknowledgement. If you would like to request an industry data model blueprint, please contact Vlocity Support at support@vlocity.com or log a case specifying which industry diagram you desire and where you want it sent (mailing address).\n\nNOTE The content on this page may only be viewed by customers or partners of Salesforce who are authorized users of Salesforce cloud business applications pursuant to an agreement between Vlocity and such customer or partner, or in the absence of any such agreement, the terms at https://vlocity.com/terms (in either case, the \"Main Agreement\").
