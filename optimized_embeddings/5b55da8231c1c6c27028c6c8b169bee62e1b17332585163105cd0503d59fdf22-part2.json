No permissions are necessary for accessing prompts in Lightning Experience.\nCreate Prompts\nProvide helpful content to users where they’re working. Introduce users to new features, draw attention to specific details in their environment, and provide nudges or reminders.\nCreate Walkthroughs\nConnect multiple prompts for a hands-on interactive tour that onboards users or introduces features. Each prompt becomes a step in the walkthrough.\nPreview and Test In-App Guidance\nVerify that the prompts and walkthroughs that you created appear correctly for the right users. Quickly preview a prompt or walkthrough in any environment. For in-app guidance in Lightning Experience, perform more thorough quality assurance testing for all prompts and walkthroughs that a specific user can see. Test mode ignores schedule settings, global time delay settings, and user interaction analytics. You can also test prompts and walkthroughs in a sandbox.\nResolve Errors and Warnings in In-App Guidance\nErrors or warnings can sometimes appear when you’re creating or editing in-app guidance. For example, errors and warnings occur when a page doesn’t support a prompt, a page with a prompt is deleted, or a field-level error occurs. The In-App Guidance page in Setup tracks errors and warnings for each prompt or walkthrough that you created.\nLimitations for In-App Guidance in Experience Cloud Sites\nIf your company has purchased Enablement, purchased Enablement Partner Relationship Management (PRM), and created an Experience Cloud site built with Aura templates, you can create prompts and walkthroughs in a site. Some functionality that’s available for in-app guidance in Lightning Experience isn’t available for in-app guidance in Experience Cloud sites.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
