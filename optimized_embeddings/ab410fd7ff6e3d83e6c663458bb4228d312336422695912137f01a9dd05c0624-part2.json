You can specify the document type that can be associated with the uploaded document, upload the document, and map the document’s fields to the appropriate Salesforce data object’s fields. For example, you can specify that a patient's birth date in a referral form must be stored in the Birthdate field of the patient's Contact record. The extracted information can be used to create or update record fields, or to verify data that's already in the org. For example, you can check a person’s birth date against the birth date in their scanned passport.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable with Financial Services Cloud, Health Cloud, and Public Sector Solutions\nIntelligent Form Reader is available for an additional cost with the Intelligent Form Reader add-on license.\nIMPORTANT\nUsers can access OCR document scan result records only when you share the related content document record.\nThe uploaded document is changed into an image using File Rendition services and then processed by the Amazon Textract API for data extraction. The rendition process and data extraction by the Amazon Textract API are asynchronous. So, extracting data from the uploaded file can take some time. If the data extraction takes longer than 50 seconds, you can retry by uploading the file again.\nCreate an AWS Account and Assign Permissions\nCreate an AWS account for Intelligent Form Reader and assign the required permissions.\nCreate an External Credential and a Named Credential for Intelligent Form Reader\nCreate an external credential to authenticate the Amazon Web Services (AWS) account that you want to use for Intelligent Form Reader. Then create a named credential for the external credential.\nEnable Intelligent Form Reader and Configure Settings\nEnable Intelligent Form Reader to use optical character recognition for extracting data. Configure the maximum number of pages that can be extracted at a time and the confidence score threshold. Enable Amazon Textract Analyze ID to extract information from identity documents.\nCreate Document Types and Templates\nCreate document types for each type of document that you want to extract information from. For example, if you want to extract information from identity documents, create a document type that can be used for all identity documents. Create a template for each document type. Then, specify the objects and the object record types where you want to store the information extracted from the uploaded documents.\nMap Document Fields to Object and Record Type Fields\nIntelligent Form Reader extracts data from the incoming document and stores them in document fields. Select an object and an associated record type to store the extracted data, and then map document fields to the fields of the selected object and record type.\nExtract Tables for Intelligent Form Reader\nEnable Amazon Textract Tables to extract tabular information from the documents.\nExtraction Using Queries for Intelligent Form Reader\nEnable Amazon Textract Queries to extract information using natural language queries.\nView and Manage Your Templates\nIn the template page, the extracted document appears as a thumbnail with the extraction status details. The auto-extracted fields appear in the Document Fields column. You can change the view of the extracted document pages, and navigate across documents and pages of a document.\nFlow Actions\nExtract text from an uploaded document or get the active OCR template details by using actions in Salesforce Flows.\nSample Flow to Extract and Store Text in Records\nCreate a flow in Flow Builder with the Intelligent Form Reader Flow actions to extract text from uploaded documents or based on one or more content document IDs, and to get the active OCR template details. Then use Apex to create records for storing the extracted text.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
