Create metadata for the trails, modules, and units that you want to publish, and format your unit content. You also use Trailmaker Content to maintain published content.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER ROLES\nThis topic supports these enablement site roles:\tContent Creators\nConsiderations for Managing Content in Trailmaker Content\nIn Trailmaker Content, your workspace is where you set up new trails or modules based on drafts that you already created and finalized in another collaboration tool. You can also import backpacks for trails and modules that other content creators have created.\nAPI Names for Trails, Modules, and Units\nEach content collection, release, trail, module, and unit on your enablement site has its own API name, which is a globally unique ID that references a content path in URLs.\nMetadata for Trails, Modules, and Units\nWhen you create trails, modules, and units, you also create metadata about your content, such as the title, description, and target audience. Learners can filter the content on your enablement site based on the metadata values you assign.\nBackpacks for Trails and Modules\nA backpack is a ZIP file that contains your content’s source files that you can download, back up, or upload. An individual backpack can be up to 50 MB. You can download a backpack for content that’s in your local Trailmaker Content workspace, or download a backpack for content published from Trailmaker Release.\nCreate Content Quickly with Content Templates\nAdd learning content to your company’s enablement site without creating trails, modules, and units from scratch. To immediately add quality content to your enablement site, we recommend that you download Salesforce content templates (formerly content kits). Content templates provide finished modules on topics that are applicable to any company. For example, add content about sales and service strategies, inclusiveness and diversity, or collaboration in a virtual workplace.\nCreate a Module in Trailmaker Content\nA module can stand alone or be a part of a trail. When you’re ready to create a module and its units, move the final draft of your content from a word processor into Trailmaker Content.\nPreview a Module in Trailmaker Content\nPreview a module and units that you’re working on in your local Trailmaker Content workspace, and share the preview with collaborators. This preview provides an opportunity for content creators and collaborators to review formatted content before it’s added to a release. The preview is read-only, limited to one module, and isn’t available for a trail.\nCreate a Trail in Trailmaker Content\nYou can create a trail and add modules from the Trailmaker Content workspace.\nDownload a Backpack from Trailmaker Content\nYou can download the backpack ZIP file for a module or trail that’s in your Trailmaker Content workspace. Then, you can submit the backpack to your company’s version control system (VCS) so that other users can import the backpack into their own local Trailmaker Content workspace.\nImport a Backpack into Trailmaker Content\nYou can add learning content into your workspace from a backpack ZIP file that you saved or downloaded. This workflow is helpful when you want to collaborate on content that other content creators started in their own workspace. Or, follow these steps when you want to update published content or restore archived content. You can also import a content template that you downloaded.\nFormat Content in Trailmaker Content\nAs you work in Trailmaker Content, use the formatting toolbar to style the content of your units. Trailmaker saves your changes to the cloud every few seconds.\nAdd Media in Trailmaker Content\nYou can insert images and videos in your enablement content.\nCreate Quizzes in Trailmaker Content\nEach unit in a module ends with a quiz to gauge how well users absorbed the content. Taking the quiz is also how users earn points. You create each quiz from the unit page in Trailmaker Content.\nAdd Content to a Release from Trailmaker Content\nAfter you create your module and quizzes and assign all the necessary metadata, add the content to a release.\nSEE ALSO\nPreview a Module in Trailmaker Content\nPreview a Release in Trailmaker Release\nTrailhead: Writing for an Enablement Site\nTrailhead: Trailmaker Content Basics\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
