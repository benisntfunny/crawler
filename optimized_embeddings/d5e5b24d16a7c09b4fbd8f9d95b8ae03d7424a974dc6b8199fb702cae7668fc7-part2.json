You can also customize the links that appear in the footer of each page. And you can designate the pages where your users land when they log out or click the Help icon. These customizations persist across your enablement site.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER ROLES\nThis topic supports these enablement site roles:\tSalesforce Admins\nCustomize the Logo or Today Page Banner\nStyle your company’s enablement site with a logo and banner image. The logo appears at the top of every page, while the banner appears across the top of the Today page.\nAdd Your Brand Color\nWhen you choose your brand color, Trailmaker adjusts the color as necessary for accessibility and legibility. The page header text is white and gray. We recommend not using white, yellow, or another pale hue for your brand color. Select a darker color for text to make it more readable.\nCustomize the URLs for the Help and Logout Landing Pages\nYou can direct your enablement site users to your own help site, instead of Salesforce Help, when they click the help icon. And when your users log out of your enablement site, you can designate the page where they land.\nCustomize the Links in Your Enablement Site Page Footer\nYou can display links that are relevant to your company and your users in the page footer on your enablement site. Include links to your company’s Experience Cloud site, privacy statement, terms of service—whatever you like. You can designate up to three custom links.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
