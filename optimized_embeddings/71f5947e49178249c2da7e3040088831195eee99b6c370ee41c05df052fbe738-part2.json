An API user may not be set up correctly.\nProactive Monitoring will send the Customer an outbound case to alert on the problem and quickly help with diagnosing underlying causes. If approved, using impersonation, the user can be unlocked by a Monitoring Engineer.\nOnce the root cause is identified, the issue may require tuning and optimization to mitigate future occurrences.\nData\tData Extension Threshold Count\tIdentify a Data Extension risk by monitoring the size of a Data Extension at a given time. This monitor is designed to detect whether a Data Extension contains too many or too few records according to a Customer defined threshold to alert on.\nData\tLarge Data Export Notification\tProactive Monitoring will notify if any large export or download (and provide the user details) happens to help Customers stay aligned with audit/compliance and security policies.\nAutomation\tScheduled or Triggered Automations\tTo protect mission critical Customer data/file related processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound case to alert on any problematic automation issues detected, and quickly help with diagnosing underlying causes in the following automation job conditions:\n\n1. Automation Not Running on Schedule\n2. Automation Running Long\n3. Automation Errored\n4. Automation Skipped\n5. Automation Stopped\n6. Automation Paused\n7. Automation Last Run Time\n8. Critical Send Automation: Milestone Status (Build start, rate, duration. Send start, rate, duration. Running long. Automation Final Completion) \n\nOnce identified, the issue may require tuning and optimization to mitigate future occurrences.\n \nEmail\tEmail Send Speed\tTo protect mission critical Customer email sends, especially time sensitive ones, Proactive Monitoring can monitor email send speed, based on agreed send speed criteria. The Proactive Monitoring Team will monitor the successful delivery of the email job, send an outbound case to alert on any send issues/slowdowns detected, and help with quickly diagnosing underlying causes. Once identified, the issue may require tuning and optimization to mitigate future occurrences.\nEmail\tHigh Priority Email Send\tTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send customers an outbound case to alert on high priority email jobs have failed to start, if the job’s build speed is slow, if the entire job has stopped, is running long or even if the job’s send speed is slower than expected. Set this for specific email jobs, or jobs with large audience sizes.\nEmail\tEmail Triggered Sends\tTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound case to alert on any problematic email triggered send issues detected, and quickly help with diagnosing underlying causes in the following conditions:\n\n1. Errored\n2. Queue Age\n\nOnce identified, the issue may require tuning and optimization to mitigate future occurrences\nEmail\tEmail Triggered Send Threshold Check\tTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound case to alert on any triggered sends that are outside of agreed parameters: based on X threshold sent in specified period of time. Measure for below or greater than X threshold, where X is defined by the Customer.\nEmail\tDeliverability\tTo protect mission critical Customer email sends, Proactive Monitoring will send customers an outbound case to alert on email jobs that have exceeded their defined total bounce, hard bounce, or block bounce thresholds. An audience threshold is defined by the customer to determine which email jobs should be monitored. This can include or exclude triggered send jobs. \nMobile\tMobile Sends\tTo protect mission critical Customer mobile sends, Proactive Monitoring can monitor for problematic mobile send conditions. The Proactive Monitoring Team will send an outbound case to alert on any send issues detected, and help with quickly diagnosing underlying causes in the following conditions:\n\n1. Errored\n2. Queue Age\n\nOnce identified, the issue may require tuning and optimization to mitigate future occurrences.\nMobile\tMobile Threshold Check\tTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound case to alert on any mobile sends that are outside of agreed parameters: based on X threshold sent in specified period of time. Measure for below or greater than X threshold, where X is defined by the Customer.\nMobile\tMobile Zero Sends\tTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound case to alert that its been more than X minutes since the scheduled start time and the process has sent to zero subscribers, with X defined by the Customer. \nJourney Builder\tJourney Builder Email Sends\tTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound case to alert of any problematic Journey Builder email send issues detected, and quickly help with diagnosing underlying causes in the following conditions:\n\n1. Errored\n2. Queue Age\n\nOnce identified, the issue may require tuning and optimization to mitigate future occurrences.\nJourney Builder\tJourney Builder Threshold Check\tTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound message to alert on any Journey Builder sends that are outside of agreed parameters: based on X threshold sent in specified period of time. Measure for below or greater than X threshold, where X is defined by the Customer.\nJourney Builder\tJourney Builder Zero Injections\t\n\nTo protect mission critical Customer processes, Proactive Monitoring will send Customers an outbound case to alert when either a zero injection DE/Automation event occurs once, X consecutive times, or has no successful injections after X hours from the last zero injection. Does not monitor Salesforce Data Events, API Events, Legacy Contact Events, or CloudPage events.\n\n\nMarketing Cloud Connect\tData Sync Deferment\tWhen the Marketing Cloud Connect integration encounters Expired Credentials for the Salesforce System user, Invalid Credentials for the Salesforce System user, or too many concurrent API requests on the Salesforce CRM application it will be placed into Data Sync Deferment. Proactive Monitoring will monitor and alert if an account is in deferment state (deferment state is checked once a day and stored until the deferment is confirmed, or until the account has been corrected since the deferment was initiated). \n\n\nMarketing Cloud  \nConnect\n\n\t\n\n\nSynchronized\nData\nStalled                          \n\n\t\n\nProactive Monitoring looks at specified Marketing Cloud Connect synchronized data extensions to ensure that new records have been created within the definable time threshold. This ensures that updates being made in the CRM are reflected in the synchronized data extension.\n\n\n\n\nMarketing Cloud  \nConnect\n\n\t\n\n\nTracking Stalled                                          \n\n\t\n\nProactive Monitoring will monitor the creation of new tracking subscriptions for Marketing Cloud Connect integrated sends. This will confirm that the most recent sends are creating salesforce tracking subscriptions within the defined time threshold and therefore sending tracking and email interaction information to the CRM.\n\n\n\n\nSalesforce may change the Proactive Monitoring, Smart Alert Catalog from time to time in its sole discretion.   While every effort is made to keep the catalog current, the Proactive Services team should be consulted to determine if a monitor is suitable for the needed use-case and is available to be implemented. SFDC will provide customers with advanced notice of any planned downtime.\n\nKnowledge Article Number\n\n000382045\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
