Build Enablement milestones, add your exercise content, and organize your program in Program Builder. Review considerations and guidelines along the way.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nFull Enablement is available with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nEnablement Lite is available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\nPartner Enablement is available with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions. A supported PRM add-on license is required.\nGuidelines for Assembling Enablement Programs\nWith your Enablement measures planned and implemented, and your content ready to go, bring all the ingredients together in Program Builder. Organize your programs appropriately to help users have efficient, enjoyable experiences that help them achieve outcomes and milestones. Write helpful and instructive titles and descriptions for users who take your programs.\nManaging Outcomes and Milestones for Enablement Programs\nAssign measurable goals based on real, job-related activity in Salesforce to your Enablement users as part of a program. Specify an optional outcome that represents the program’s most significant and measurable goal. Add incremental milestones that represent smaller, bite-sized achievements on the way to the outcome. For an outcome and each milestone, select the Enablement measures that define the specific objects, fields, and field value criteria for the activity you want to track. When Enablement users start working toward an outcome or milestone, they see their progress in the flow of the program. You can track users’ progress with Enablement dashboards and reports.\nExercise Types in Enablement Programs\nThe Program Builder palette includes several types of exercises that determine the content you provide and how users experience the content when they take the program.\nManaging Digital Experiences Content for Exercises in Enablement Programs\nThe Enablement add-on license provisions a workspace named Enablement in the Digital Experiences app, where you manage the content that you want to use for exercises in Enablement programs. Define a link to specific content one time and easily reuse that content across multiple programs. Manage rich text and images for Lesson exercises, embedded videos for Video exercises, and links to your company’s existing resources—PDFs, slide decks, webinars, recordings, and so on—for other exercise types.\nManaging Einstein Coach for Feedback Request Exercises\nEinstein for Sales with an Enablement add-on license allows Enablement admins to use Einstein generative-AI in sales programs in Lightning Experience. Create a Feedback Request exercise that uses AI to provide your sales reps with personal, timely, and actionable feedback on their sales pitches. Use this feedback to learn each seller’s strengths and growth areas and understand how to best coach them in their role.\nManaging Assessment Surveys for Feedback Request Exercises\nFor sales programs in Lightning Experience, Enablement users can submit a link to content that they want reviewed and select peers, managers, or other sales leaders to provide feedback. For example, a sales rep records themselves practicing their pitch, uploads the recording to a video platform, and then invites experienced sales leaders to give feedback. Feedback Request exercises for peer and manager feedback use assessment surveys, which include rating and short text questions for the reviewers to complete. After the reviewers provide their feedback, Enablement users can view the feedback in the Guidance Center. Enablement admins can use feedback response analytics to gain insight about users’ behavioral changes as they progress through a program.\nCustom Exercise Types in Enablement Programs\nCustom exercise types let you bring content from your own repository or a third-party repository into your Enablement program. From the Program Builder palette, add custom exercise types designed for your company to your Enablement programs. The custom exercise you add to your program determines the type of content you can provide. When Enablement users take a program, they view the custom exercise content in the flow of the program.\nSEE ALSO\nCreate Enablement Programs Based on Templates\nDriving Business Outcomes with Enablement\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
