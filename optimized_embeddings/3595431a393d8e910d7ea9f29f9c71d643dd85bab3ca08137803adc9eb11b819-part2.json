During the sync process, modified data is uploaded from a device to Salesforce and only the required data is downloaded from Salesforce.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience in Professional, Unlimited, and Enterprise Editions that have Consumer Goods Cloud enabled.\n\nField reps can manually initiate a sync. The manual sync options are:\n\nSync: Verifies the modified records and syncs the data.\nFirst-Sync-of-Day: Clears the synced data that is no longer required on a mobile device and syncs records based on record IDs. You can use the CANCEL option to cancel the initiated synchronization process.\n\nUse the Sync Configuration page of the Sync Management app to configure sync options.\n\nBackground Sync: Initiates background sync by configuring a timer. The options to configure a background sync are:\nComplete Sync: Syncs the records of tracked objects.\nUpload Only: Ensures that data is only uploaded.\nDeactivated: Ensures that the auto background sync isn’t initiated. Field reps can manually initiate the sync by tapping the Sync icon in the mobile app.\nOn the Road Sync: Only the Tracked Objects that are flagged for On The Road Sync are synced.\nInitial Sync: Syncs tracked objects, named fetched trees (NFTs), Runtime Artifacts (RTAs), and metadata and is triggered when you start the Sync Management app for the first time.\nOn-Demand Sync: Syncs tracked objects, NFTs, and uploads the changes in the upload queue. Business Logic calls trigger this sync.\nSync on Online: Executes the last sync attempt that wasn’t complete and is triggered when an online connection is available. Syncs tracked objects.\nSync On Resume: Executes the last incomplete sync attempt and is triggered when mobile devices are connected to the network. Syncs tracked objects.\nSync On Startup: Syncs the schema and RTAs whenever the Consumer Goods Cloud offline mobile app is launched. You can opt to sync tracked objects and NFTs.\n\nConfiguration and sync options impact the Consumer Goods Cloud offline mobile app. During sync processes, visual indicators on the Consumer Goods Cloud offline mobile app show detailed progress of each sync action. After First-Sync-of-Day sync is initiated, user interaction is blocked until the sync is completed.\n\nComponents of the Sync Process\nConfigure the sync process using the Sync Management app.\nInitiate a Sync Process\nThe first sync performed after installing the mobile app is called Initial Sync. Based on the configuration, initiate syncs whenever the Consumer Goods offline mobile app is launched.\nMonitor Sync Progress\nIn the Sync page of the Consumer Goods mobile app, view the step-by-step sync progress during different sync types performed on the mobile devices. No activity can be performed on the mobile until the sync completes.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
