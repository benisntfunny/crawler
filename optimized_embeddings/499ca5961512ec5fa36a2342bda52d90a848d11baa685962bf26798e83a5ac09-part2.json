You can create original content directly in a CMS workspace using the CMS content editor, or import content to a workspace from another source. When you publish content, it’s shared with all channels associated with that CMS workspace. You can see how your content looks on your site, and set up publication schedules to plan the delivery to your CMS channels.\n\nManaged content and variants of managed content items are considered one content record. For example, a managed content item with three translations is one record. CMS content refers to content created and added to your CMS workspaces. You can add other kinds of content to an Experience Cloud site such as Salesforce CRM data. To work with content such as Salesforce files and libraries, Salesforce knowledge, or an external CMS, see Find Your Way Around Experience Workspaces.\n\nNOTE Take time to consider your needs and plan your site’s content management strategy.\nCMS Content Types\nUse content types to filter content in your workspace, create collections, and stay organized. Salesforce CMS comes with three standard content types: Document, Image, and News. You can also create custom content types for your specific needs, like blog posts or product announcements. To create custom content types, use the ManagedContent API or CMS Content Type Manager in AppExchange.\nView CMS Content Details in Enhanced CMS Workspaces\nThe content detail page in enhanced CMS workspaces gives a summary of a content item. If the content item has variants, you can switch between them from the left navigation menu. In the center column, see a quick view of the content. View content details, version history, and see where the content is published or referenced. Edit, publish, or unpublish, and run content workflows for your content.\nView Content Version History in Salesforce CMS\nOn the content detail page, the Version History list shows all versions of a content item, its status, and the date and time it was last modified.\nCreate and Clone Content in a CMS Workspace\nCreate original or clone existing content. Content is specific to the workspace, and you create it in the default language for the workspace.\nEdit Content in a CMS Workspace\nEdit draft or published CMS content, without changing what’s live in your CMS channels.\nPublish Content to CMS Channels\nMake content available for use in CMS channels with manual publishing.\nUnpublish Content from CMS Channels\nRemove content from published destinations and make it unavailable for use in CMS channels with manual unpublishing.\nDelete Content in a CMS Workspace\nAs your business grows and changes, so does your content. To keep your workspace tidy, delete unpublished CMS content. Deleting content removes all versions and variants from your workspace.\nWork with Image Content in Salesforce CMS\nUpdating your Salesforce CMS content with images is easy, and there’s lots of flexibility when you work with image references in other content.\nSalesforce CMS Content Key\nThe Salesforce CMS content key is a unique identifier that sticks with your content through version updates and across Salesforce orgs, sites, and components. You can use the content key to copy content between orgs, such as from sandbox to production, using the Salesforce CMS export and import feature.\nExport and Import Content with Salesforce CMS\nGet an overview of how to add content to a CMS or enhanced CMS workspace, or transfer content from one org to another. Learn more about how to format and handle content in some common use-case scenarios.\nTranslate Salesforce CMS Content\nTo meet the global demands of your business, offer your content in multiple languages. First, set up your CMS workspace with the languages you require. Then manage the content through the translation lifecycle, from draft to publish.\nCreate Content Publication Schedules in Salesforce CMS\nPublish and unpublish Salesforce CMS content at designated dates and times.\nCMS Workflows and Approvals\nYour CMS workspace grows and changes with time, which makes role-based workflows useful and sometimes necessary. Workflows allow content creators to request an approval, translation, or anything else you can dream up, directly from a content item and send that request directly to the relevant user. The workflow captures a full audit trail of each assigned or completed step. With workflows, you always know where you are in the process and who’s responsible for the next step.\nAdd Sidebar Extensions to the CMS Content Editor\nUse sidebar extensions to add productivity tools to the content editor in an enhanced CMS workspace. Streamline your content workflow with spell checkers, grammar editors, content recommendations, and translation services. Search AppExchange for extensions created by Salesforce partners, or use Lightning web components to build your own.\nAdd Videos to Content from the Rich Text Editor\nEmbed video in rich text fields to enliven your content with product reviews, promotional videos, instructional walk-throughs, and more.\nSEE ALSO\nAdd Salesforce CMS Content to Your Experience Builder Site\nRole-Based Access in Salesforce CMS\nCMS Developer Guide: Connect Your External CMS to Your Experience Builder Site\nSelect a Security Level in Experience Builder Sites\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
