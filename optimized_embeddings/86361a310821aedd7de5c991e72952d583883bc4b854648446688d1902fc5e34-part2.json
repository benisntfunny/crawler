Links and other resources help you link carts to quotes.\n\nBest Practices\n\nConfiguring the Marketing Cloud Connector Data Feeds\n\nIdentify Scope, Requirements, Validate Alignment\n\nPlan for your budget, timeline, and out-of-the-box options.\n\nPlan and gather alignment on your data strategy and connected cloud. Consider your timeline and budget.\nDefine an MVP solution by preparing a crawl, walk, and run prioritization for storefront and CPQ requirements.\nTo implement new functionality, assign ownership of work items to cross-functional teams.\n\nMonitor error logs, and subscribe to reports.\n\nAssign ownership for bugs, and issue tracking with a SLA across system, functional, and business analysis to monitor error logs between tools.\n\nValidate your data strategy when adding to user stories or a business process.\n\nRefer to the Product and Price Master Data flow and Design Considerations for ERP. This solution kit assumes that you use the Product CPQ Master approach.\nKey Considerations\n\nData from the Connector\n\nStorefront and Connector Orders also create Opportunities.\nCarts that generate quotes and quotes that generate carts don’t require an Opportunity record.\n\nCart-to-Quote Requests\n\nRequest Quote runs at any time from the customer’s cart or the “CC Order” creation.” Either way, CPQ makes Quote then Quote Items data after the storefront makes a request.\nAfter Request a Quote initiation from an Order, CPQ data populates in the following order: Opportunity, Quote, Quote Line Items and Order, and Order Items.\nLimitations and Guardrails\n\nTransfer Orders to Storefront Cart\n\nWhen a sales rep transfers a quote to a cart in the customer’s view, a custom Lightning Action on the Quote page supports this action.\n\nCart-to-Quote Behavior with CPQ Price Rules and Overrides\n\nExclude Quotes created from the Cart for any “Pricing rules” or “Quote Calculator Plugin (QCP)” overrides. The price published from “Cart to Quote” drives price overrides.\nPerformance and Scalability Considerations\n\nNotifications\n\nConfigure transactional alerts through the Cart-to-Quote or Quote-to-Cart notification preferences. Review out-of-the-box options within Salesforce for email delivery via Process Builder, Marketing Cloud Account Engagement (Pardot) with Sales Alerts (Salesforce Engage Alerts), or by Marketing Cloud. Learn more about native notification options.\n\nMonitor and Manage the Error Log\n\nCart Order and Quote errors appear in the CPQB2B Log object.\nCreate reports by setting up a Custom Report Type. Monitor performance and swarm issues that negatively affect the customer shopping experience.\n\nPermissions and Security\n\nRecord ownership from Connector transactions. If your Salesforce storefront supports unauthenticated shopping, it creates CC Cart and CC Order under the logged in Salesforce Experience site user context or the Anonymous User Context.\nSee Also\nCPQ | B2B Connector Setup and Implementation Guide\nB2B Commerce Data Model\nService Agent Order on Behalf Flow\nRelated Content\n\t\n\nReview earlier steps in this solution.\n\nWorkflow\n\n\t\n\nTake the next steps in this implementation.\n\nConnector\nConfigurations\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
