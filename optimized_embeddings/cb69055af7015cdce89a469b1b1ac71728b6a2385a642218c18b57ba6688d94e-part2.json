By default, anyone who can see a file can share it.\n\nTo share a file with one or more users in your company:\n\nStart by sharing the file from one of these locations:\nNext to the file on Files home, click Share.\nOn the detail page of the file you want to share, click Share.\nFrom the file preview player, click \nEnter the name of the person who you want to share the file with, and select the name by clicking it. To share with more than one person, enter more names.\nChoose the file permission you want your audience to have. By default, they have collaborator permission, which lets them view, download, share, change permission, edit the file, and upload new versions. To give your audience permission to view, download, and share files, select Viewer.\nOptionally, add information to the message that recipients receive.\nClick Share and Close. Recipients receive a link to the file and a message that you have shared a file with them. Lightning Experience users receive this message as an email notification. Salesforce Classic users get a private Chatter message on their My Messages page on the Chatter tab. If Classic users have email notifications for Chatter messages enabled, they also get an email notification.\n\nIf you want to stop sharing with a person or a group, in the Sharing Settings dialog box, click  next to the person or group's name.\n\nTo see everyone the file is shared with, from the Share File window, click Who Can Access. Update file permissions or stop sharing the file by clicking  next to the name of a person or group. To prevent others from changing who can access the file, select Prevent others from sharing and unsharing.\n\nNOTE\nThere is no share button or option on the file detail page on an Experience Cloud site or in an internal org, if the file originated from the site.\nDocuments from the Documents tab and attachments from the Notes and Attachments related list aren't listed on Files home. They can't be shared as Salesforce Files.\nIf content files are part of a content pack or delivery, they can be shared with more people than are shown in Share with People.\nA file can be shared a maximum of 2000 times. This count includes shares with records, people, and groups. If a file is approaching the maximum number of shares, consider creating a public link or making the file public by posting it to your feed.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
