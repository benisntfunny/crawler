Users can add topics to records to organize them by common themes.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: all editions\n\nYour employees can add topics to records based on what they're seeing in the field and from working with customers. In this way, topics can give your business insight into the voice of your customer. And because topics can cross objects, they can provide connections across people, conversations, and records.\n\nIf your company uses Chatter, users can also add topics to posts. Topics on posts help users organize posts and increase their visibility. Topics are great for discussing a particular issue, theme, or subject, that isn’t limited to a particular group of people. For example, imagine that your company has created a year-long goal around volunteering with local schools. You can create a topic to allow your entire company to share posts, photos, and updates related to the company goal.\n\nUsers can search Chatter posts and Knowledge articles by topic. No other tagged record types return search results.\n\nConfigure Topics for Records in Lightning Experience\nAdd the Topics component to record pages so that your users can assign topics to records. Topics allow your users to organize records by theme. On the topic detail page, users can see all the records with a topic and filter their record list views by topic.\nEnable and Configure Topics for Objects in Salesforce Classic\nEnable topics for objects so that users can add topics to records and organize them by common themes. This powerful feature is available with or without Chatter.\nDelete Topics\nPeople with the right permissions can delete topics directly from topic detail pages.\nTopics Privacy\nTopic names and descriptions are not private, even for topics that appear solely in private groups and on records. Posts and records with topics have the same security and privacy as posts and records without topics.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
