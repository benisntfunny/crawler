Rebate payouts are created in the Program Rebate Type Payout Source, Program Rebate Type Payout, and the Rebate Program Member Payout objects. Program managers can also view the payout details in the Member Payouts related list of Rebate Program Payout Period records.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions that have Rebate Management enabled.\n\nThe following objects get updated regularly each time the scheduled flow to calculate payouts run.\n\nProgram Rebate Type Payout Source: One payout source record is created for each aggregate row generated by the calculation definition. It shows the rebate amount and the tier applied for that aggregate.\nProgram Rebate Type Payout: Sums up all payout sources and provides a summary of rebate amount for each rebate type. For example, the volume rebate for a program member in Jan 2020 could be $1,000, and the growth rebate for the same member and period could be $20,00.\nRebate Program Member Payout: Displays the rebate amount for the member and period. For example, the rebate amount computed for a rebate program member in Jan 2020 could be $21,000.\n\nOn the Payout tab of a Rebate Program Member record, find the following details:\n\nSummary: Shows the total payout received by the account for all periods and all rebate types.\nSummary by Rebate Type: Shows the total payout received by the account for all periods, for each rebate type.\nOne row for each payout period: Shows the total payout received by the account for each payout period.\n\nA Rebate Program Member Payout record can be in one of the following statuses.\n\nSTATUS\tWHAT DOES IT MEAN?\tADJUSTMENTS ALLOWED?\nCalculation in Progress\tThe values get updated each time the scheduled flow to calculate payouts from aggregate records run.\tYes\nCalculated\tThe final values are updated on the payout calculation date of a payout period.
