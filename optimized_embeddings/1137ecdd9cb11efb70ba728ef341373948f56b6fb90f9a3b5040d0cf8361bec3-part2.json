But the new interface affects the way some features, such as Lightning Pages and Visualforce, behave.\n\nVisualforce\n\nHere are some of the most important considerations for orgs that have customized Salesforce with Visualforce. For complete details, score yourself a new developer badge by completing Visualforce & Lightning Experience in Trailhead.\n\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nDisplay in the entire page\t\t\tIn Salesforce Classic, Visualforce owns the entire page. In Lightning Experience, it’s wrapped in an embedded iframe and hides the <apex:page> showHeader and showSidebar attributes.\nwindow.location\t\t\tA common technique in JavaScript to navigate to a new page is to manipulate the window.location value. This technique isn’t possible in Lightning Experience. Use the sforce.one navigation methods instead.\nRelated list previews\t\t\t\n\nRelated list views don't automatically refresh data for Visualforce pages in Lightning Experience. Reload the page to see the new data.\n\nLightning components that use Lightning Data Service to perform DML operations don’t have the same limitations regarding related list previews. If you can’t update your Lightning component to use Lightning Data Service, you can explicitly trigger a page refresh by firing the force:refreshView event after the Apex call completes.\n\nWe recommend migrating affected Visualforce pages to Lightning components.\n\nS-Controls\n\nS-controls are an obsolete method of customizing the Salesforce user interface. They are superseded by Visualforce and Lightning Components, which are superior in every way. S-controls aren’t available in Lightning Experience, and never will be. If your org depends on s-controls, you must replace them before you can move to Lightning Experience.\n\nSEE ALSO\nWhat’s the Fate of Existing Salesforce Customizations?\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
