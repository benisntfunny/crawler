Rules are defined as records in a standard object, custom object, or a custom metadata type. A decision table can read up to 100,000 rules.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with Loyalty Management or Rebate Management\nNOTE Decision tables are also available as part of Business Rules Engine. If your org has Business Rules Engine enabled, see Decision Tables for Business Rules Engine.\n\nThe object or the custom metadata type contains fields that are used as inputs and outputs in the decision table. Input fields use values from the business rules to evaluate field values or user-specified values, and provide outcomes.\n\nWhen values match a particular rule, the decision table provides the value of the output field of the matched rule as the outcome. If a value matches multiple rules, the decision table provides a list of outcomes.\n\nIMPORTANT If a rule doesn't have values for specific input fields, the decision table ignores the blank fields when evaluating a value. The decision table then can provide multiple outcomes. An outcome results when the specified values match with a rule based on the input fields condition of the decision table. Outcomes result when rules that don't have values for one or more input fields and the values of the remaining input fields match based on the input fields condition.\n\nGroup your business rules with a frequently used input field and run up to 1,000,000 calls in an hour.\n\nNOTE You can't use these standard objects as the source for your rules:\nAccount\nContact\nLead\nOpportunity\nCase\nEXAMPLE A company has three business rules. The first rule is that a product that's categorized as a shoe and is priced at US$500 or less is discounted by 5%. The second rule is that shoes priced between US$500 and US$1,500 are discounted by 10%. The third rule is that all products up to US$2,000 are discounted by 8%. The custom object that contains the rules is named Product Discount Rules. The object contains four fields: Category, Lowest Price Point, Highest Price Point, and Discount. The object contains three rules, each containing the details of one rule.\n\nThe first record contains these values:\n\nCategory: Shoe\nLowest Price Point: US$0\nHighest Price Point: US$500\nDiscount: 5%\n\nThe second record contains these values:\n\nCategory: Shoe\nLowest Price Point: US$501\nHighest Price Point: US$1,500\nDiscount: 10%\n\nThe third record contains these values:\n\nCategory: —\nLowest Price Point: US$0\nHighest Price Point: US$2,000\nDiscount: 8%\n\nCategory, Lowest Price Point, and Highest Price Point are inputs in the decision table and Discount is the output. A shoe worth US$400 is evaluated by the decision table. It checks the rules and provides 5% as the outcome because the shoe matches the first rule. When the decision table evaluates another shoe priced at US$750, it provides two outcomes: 10% and 8% because the product matches the second and third rules. It matches the third rule because an input field (Category) in the rule doesn't have a value, and the shoe isn't evaluated against that input field. So, based on the price alone, the shoe also matches the third rule.\n\nBusiness Rule Grouping\nGroup your business rules with a frequently used input field to reduce the number of rows to process. Grouping splits your business rules into multiple groups and evaluates only the required group.\nSEE ALSO\nDecision Table Key Terms and Workflow\nCustom Object with Product Discount Rules (Example)\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
