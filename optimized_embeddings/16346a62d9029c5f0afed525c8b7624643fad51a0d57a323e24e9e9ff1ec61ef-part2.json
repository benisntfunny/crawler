Learners have visibility over your staff's availability in any department, based on their configured topics and appointment channels. They can view and schedule appointments, and even join virtually if you set up that feature. Your staff can also schedule appointments on behalf of learners from their records. Unifying all departments on a single scheduling tool increases your learners' ability to use all of your services.\n\nSet Up Appointment Scheduling for Education Cloud\nEnable Salesforce Scheduler for Education Cloud, and control who can schedule appointments, and how. Fine-tune sharing settings to control the learners' and staff's access to Salesforce objects, and create and assign permission sets to represent your staff's availability. Build a data model that supports your institution—staff members and teams, locations, appointment topics, and much more—to create a flexible and powerful appointment scheduling solution.\nEnable Learners to Schedule Appointments Via Self-Service\nConfigure learners as Experience Cloud users to grant them access to a preconfigured self-service portal to schedule appointments, on desktop or mobile. When learners and staff log in to the portal, they get a comprehensive view of their schedule, and see their past and upcoming appointments. From that portal, they can choose topics, time slots, appointment channels, and teams or team members for appointments. If you configure video calls with AWS Chime, learners can also start virtual appointments directly from there.\nCustomize the Appointment Self-Service Setup Flow\nThe self-service appointment setup flow is built on OmniStudio components that retrieve data from the learners' records. Customize those components to best suit your institution's needs in a user-friendly, click-based interface to offer a rich, personalized experience to your users. Add static or dynamic information to increase learners' engagement and awareness such as by communicating upcoming campus events or holiday closures.\nSet Up Virtual Appointments\nHost appointments from anywhere by setting up virtual calls with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Chime SDK or another video call service. Education Cloud's appointment feature seamlessly integrates with AWS, and lets your users join calls directly from the Salesforce app or the self-service portal. Turn on closed captioning to meet accessibility standards to support all your learners.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
