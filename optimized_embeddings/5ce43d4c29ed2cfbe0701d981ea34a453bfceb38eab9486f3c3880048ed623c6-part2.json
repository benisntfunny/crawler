Starting in Winter ‘24 a version of Privacy Center on the Salesforce platform is available. For more information, see Privacy Center: Satisfy Customer Requests and Data Privacy Laws.\n\nData protection and data management are key contributors to improved customer trust. In a data-driven world, customers are increasingly privacy conscious. They want to buy from companies that keep their personal information safe and secure, and they’re loyal to businesses that prioritize privacy management. Proper data management helps ensure that businesses comply with legal regulations and avoid penalties.\n\nThere’s a lot to consider when it comes to data management, but Privacy Center is up to the challenge. As a secure data management program, Privacy Center helps you maintain customer privacy through every stage of the data lifecycle. Create policies that satisfy your customer’s right to be forgotten with the Right to Be Forgotten Policies feature. Or retain and de-identify a customer’s personally identifiable information (PII) using the Retention Policies feature. You can even create Portability Policies that compile and deliver PII to customers in response to data subject access requests. With Privacy Center, prioritizing data privacy is just a click away.\n\nFor more details on data protection laws and how Privacy Center helps you stay compliant, see the Salesforce Privacy Center Whitepaper.\n\nPrivacy Center Definitions\nKeep these terms in mind when working with Privacy Center.\nPrivacy Center and Data Governance Laws\nData protection and privacy guidelines change depending on where your customers are located. Privacy Center helps you comply with data governance laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CPPA) in the United States.\nSet Up Privacy Center and Connect to Heroku\nUse Heroku to securely store your Salesforce data. Get started by installing Salesforce Privacy Center and setting up an archive for data retention.\nManage How Customer Data Is Retained\nUnder data privacy law, your customers have a right to be forgotten from your org or for data to be restricted from processing. This means that you must delete, archive, or de-identify the data subject’s PII in your org within 30 days of their request. Always work with your legal team to ensure that you collaborate on policy creations and meet requirements set by your company. With Privacy Center, you can obfuscate a customer's PII, move it to storage, or delete it.\nSetting Up Heroku External Objects with Salesforce Connect\nIntegrate data from a Heroku Postgres database into Salesforce by using Heroku External Objects and Salesforce Connect. While the data remains in Heroku Postgres, this integration allows the data to be read from within Salesforce. Also, the data can often be written to within Salesforce.\nDelete Data with Right to Be Forgotten Policies\nFor data subjects who want their data removed, create Right to Be Forgotten policies to run on individual customer records. Create policies that capture the objects you want to delete, then manually run the policy on a specific record at any time.\nSatisfy Data Subject Access Requests\nThe Data Subject Access Request feature in Privacy Center addresses your customers’ right to obtain a copy of their personally identifiable information (PII).\nSEE ALSO\nData Deletion: Delete Personal Data\nConsent Management: Track Customer Consent and Honor Opt-Out Requests\nRestriction of Processing: Restrict How to Process Personal Data\nData Access and Portability: Give Customers Their Data when They Want It\nPrivacy Center: Satisfy Customer Requests and Data Privacy Laws\nUse Preference Manager to Gather Communication Preferences\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
