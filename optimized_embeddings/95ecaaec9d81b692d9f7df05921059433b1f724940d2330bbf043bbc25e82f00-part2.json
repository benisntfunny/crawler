When the schedule completes successfully, the published content replaces its last published version. If this content is on your site, the updated version appears on the site immediately. Unpublished content is removed from your live site and from all content that references it.\n\nCreating a content publication schedule in a CMS workspace is different from creating one in an enhanced CMS workspace.\n\nOpen the Digital Experiences app (previously named Salesforce CMS) from the App Launcher in Lightning Experience.\nIn the CMS workspace where the content was created, click the title of the content you want to schedule.\nTo work with publication schedules in a CMS workspace, follow these steps.\nTo make sure that you’re viewing the correct version of your content, refer to the Version History card.\nTo create a publication schedule for unpublished content, click Schedule Publish. To create a publication schedule for published content to unpublish from your site, click Schedule Unpublish.\nEnter a date, time, and time zone.\nYou can include other content that’s referenced by the item you’re scheduling, such as an image in a news piece, in the content publication schedule. To include referenced content, select Publish referenced content.\nIf other unpublished content references the content you’re creating a schedule for, make sure to publish it, too, because only published content appears on your site.\n\nLikewise, if you want to unpublish content that's referenced by content in a publication schedule, you must create a separate publication schedule to unpublish the referenced content.\n\nWhen you schedule content for publication, you also have the option to create an auto-unpublish schedule for that content. To create an auto-unpublish schedule or expiration for content in the publication schedule for publish, enable Auto unpublish. Then enter a date, time, and time zone.\nTo confirm and create the publication schedule, click Schedule.\nTo view the content schedule status, refresh the tab. On the workspace title tab or the content tab, click  | Refresh Tab. Then click Publication Activity.\nTo work with publication schedules in an enhanced workspace, follow these steps.\nOpen the content.\nClick Publish or Unpublish.\nSelect translations and, if applicable, related content to include in the schedule.\nEnter a date, time, and time zone.\nIf you’re creating a schedule to publish content, and you also want to create a schedule to unpublish the content, select Schedule Unpublish, and enter a date and time. \nClick Schedule.\nWork with Content Publication Schedules\nContent admins and content managers can manage publication schedules and statuses for the entire CMS workspace with the Publication Calendar. From the Publication Calendar, you can manage all scheduled content for the CMS workspace in one location. Or you can manage schedules for a content item on the Publication Activity tab of its content detail page. When you create and edit publication schedules, keep these considerations in mind.\nEdit Content Publication Schedules\nView, edit, and delete publication schedules in a CMS workspace.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
