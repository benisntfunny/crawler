If you have Apex classes that are installed from a managed package, you must compile these classes first by clicking Compile all classes on the Apex Classes page so that they appear in the list. See Manage Apex Classes.\nSelect the tests to run. The list of tests includes only classes that contain test methods.\nTo select tests from an installed managed package, select the managed package’s corresponding namespace from the drop-down list. Only the classes of the managed package with the selected namespace appear in the list.\nTo select tests that exist locally in your organization, select [My Namespace] from the drop-down list. Only local classes that aren't from managed packages appear in the list.\nTo select any test, select [All Namespaces] from the drop-down list. All the classes in the organization appear, whether or not they are from a managed package.\n\nClasses with tests currently running don't appear in the list.\n\nTo opt out of collecting code coverage information during test runs, select Skip Code Coverage.\nClick Run.\n\nAfter selecting test classes to run, the selected classes are placed in the Apex job queue for execution. The maximum number of test classes you can select for execution is the greater of 500 or 10 multiplied by the number of test classes in the org per 24-hour period. For sandbox and Developer Edition organizations, this limit is higher and is the greater of 500 or 20 multiplied by the number of test classes in the org.\n\nWhile tests are running, you can select one or more tests and click Abort to cancel.\n\nAfter a test finishes running, you can:\n\nClick the test to see result details, or if a test fails, the first error message and the stack trace display.\nClick View to see the source Apex code.\n\nTest results display for 60 minutes after they finish running.\n\nApex Test Results\nFrom Setup, enter Apex in the Quick Find box, select Apex Test Execution, then click View Test History to view all test results for your organization, not just tests that you have run. Test results are retained for 30 days after they finish running, unless cleared.\nView Apex Test Results Details\nView all test results for your organization in the default view for 30 days unless cleared, not just tests that you have run,\nApex Test History\nThe Apex Test History page shows all the test results associated with a particular test run. The page shows results only for tests that have been run asynchronously.\nSEE ALSO\nOpen the Developer Console\nApex Test Results\nView Apex Test Results Details\nView Test History\n\nUse the Apex Test Results page to see all test results for your organization.\n\nFrom Setup, enter Apex in the Quick Find box, select Apex Test Execution, then click View Test History.\nUse the Developer Console to see additional information about your test execution:\nOpen the Developer Console.\nRun your tests using the Apex Test Execution page.\nCheck the Developer Console to step through the request.\nDisable Parallel Test Execution\n\nTests that are started from the Salesforce user interface (including the Developer Console) run in parallel. Parallel test execution can speed up test run time. Sometimes, parallel test execution results in data contention issues, and you can turn off parallel execution in those cases. In particular, data contention issues and UNABLE_TO_LOCK_ROW errors might occur in the following cases.\n\nWhen tests update the same records at the same time—Updating the same records typically occurs when tests don’t create their own data and turn off data isolation to access the org’s data.\nWhen a deadlock occurs in tests that are running in parallel and that try to create records with duplicate index field values—Test data is rolled back when a test method finishes execution. A deadlock occurs when two running tests are waiting for each other to roll back data, which happens if two tests insert records with the same unique index field values in different orders.\n\nYou can prevent receiving those errors by turning off parallel test execution in the Salesforce user interface.\n\nFrom Setup, enter Apex Test Execution in the Quick Find box, select Apex Test Execution, then click Options....\nIn the Apex Test Execution Options dialog, select Disable Parallel Apex Testing and then click OK.\n\nFor more information about test data, see “Isolation of Test Data from Organization Data in Unit Tests” in the Apex Code Developer's Guide. This option doesn’t affect the execution order of tests, which continue to run asynchronously from the Apex Test Execution page.\n\nInspect Code Coverage Results\n\nAfter you run tests using the Apex Test Execution page, you can view code coverage details in the Developer Console. See Checking Code Coverage.\n\nTo reduce calculation time of overall code coverage results obtained through Estimate your organization's code coverage on the Apex Test Execution page, click Options..., select Store Only Aggregated Code Coverage, and then click OK. Use this option only when you have many tests and large volumes of Apex code, that is, when the number of Apex test methods multiplied by the number of all classes and triggers is in the range of hundreds of thousands. This option causes code coverage results to be stored in aggregate form for all test methods. As a result, you can’t view code coverage results for an individual test method, including the blue and red highlighting that shows line-by-line code coverage in the Developer Console. For more information on running tests, see Salesforce Help: Create a Test Run and Apex Developer Guide: Run Unit Test Methods.\n\nNOTE You can speed up Apex test runs by opting out of collecting code coverage information when you want faster feedback on pass or fail status rather than coverage data. When you opt out, no data about Apex test coverage is stored. To opt out, select the Skip Code Coverage option.\nUse the Independent Auto-Number Sequence Test Option\n\nThe Independent Auto-Number Sequence helps to avoid gaps in auto-number fields in your organization’s records caused by test records created in Apex tests. This option isolates theauto-numbersequence used in Apex tests from the sequence used in your organization. As a result, the creation of test data in Apex tests doesn't cause the sequence ofauto-number fields to be higher for new non-test records in your organization.\n\nIf this option isn’t enabled, there will be gaps in the auto-number field whenever Apex tests create test records with auto-number fields. For example, if Account has an auto-number field, and there are 50 account records in your organization, the field value of the last created account can be N-0050. After running an Apex test that creates five test accounts, this causes the auto-number sequence to be increased by five even though these test records aren’t committed to the database and are rolled back. Next time you create a non-test account record, its auto-number field value will be N-0056 instead of N-0051, hence, the gap in the sequence. If you enable this option before running an Apex test that creates test data, the auto-number sequence is preserved and the next non-test record will have a contiguous auto-number value of N-0051.\n\nGaps in the auto-number sequence can still occur in other situations, for example, when triggers that attempt to insert new records fail to execute and records are rolled back. In this case, gaps can’t be completely avoided because, in the same transaction, some records can be successfully inserted while others are rolled back.\n\nClick Options....\nSelect Independent Auto-Number Sequence.\nClick OK\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
