The MFA service provided by Salesforce allows the use of strong verification methods only — that is, methods that provide high assurance that the user is who they say they are. Salesforce products support several types of strong verification methods, including the Salesforce Authenticator mobile app and third-party authenticator apps. Some products also support the use of physical security keys and built-in authenticators. For your MFA implementation, choose the option or options that work best for your business and user needs.\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nTo satisfy the contractual MFA requirement that went into effect on February 1, 2022, users can log in with any of the strong verification methods supported by your Salesforce products.\n\nSalesforce MFA doesn’t allow the use of security questions or one-time passcodes delivered via email, SMS text messages, or phone calls. This restriction is due to the inherent vulnerabilities with these methods. Email credentials can be compromised and mobile phone numbers can be intercepted via SIM swapping attacks or hacked mobile device accounts.\n\nIf you have users who access Salesforce products with single sign-on (SSO), your SSO provider’s MFA services may support methods that aren’t discussed here. See the MFA FAQ for guidance on verification methods that satisfy the MFA requirement.\n\nLet’s look at the benefits and considerations for each type of verification method supported by Salesforce products.\n\nSALESFORCE AUTHENTICATOR\tTHIRD-PARTY\nAUTHENTICATOR APPS\tSECURITY KEYS*\tBUILT-IN\nAUTHENTICATORS*\nA smart and simple mobile app that users can easily connect to their Salesforce accounts.\tApps generate unique, temporary verification codes based on the OATH TOTP algorithm (specified in RFC 6238).\tPhysical devices that use public-key cryptography.\tVerify identity with fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition scan, or a PIN or password.\n\n\nForm Factor:\n\nMobile app for iOS and Android\n\n\t\n\nForm Factor:\n\nApps available for multiple operating systems\n\n\t\n\nForm Factor:\n\nUSB, Lightning, and NFC devices that support the WebAuthn and U2F standards\n\n\t\n\nForm Factor:\n\nAvailable via a device’s built-in authenticator service (Windows Hello™, Touch ID®, Face ID®, and so forth)\n\n\n\n\nUser Experience:\n\nDelivers push notifications* to users’ phones for fast access.\nSee real-time details to confirm request validity.\nDeny fraudulent requests with a tap.\nAutomates authentication from trusted locations\nGenerates TOTP codes if connectivity isn’t available.\n\t\n\nUser Experience:\n\nA wide variety of apps to choose from.\nConnectivity isn’t required.\n\t\n\nUser Experience:\n\nFast and easy to use.\nRecognizes and denies fraudulent requests.\nConnectivity isn’t required.\nNo batteries needed.\n\t\n\nUser Experience:\n\nFast and easy to use.\nNo apps required.\nStrong public-key cryptography that’s unique to the user’s account.\n\n\n\nConsiderations:\n\nRequires a mobile device.\n\t\n\nConsiderations:\n\nRequires a mobile device.\nTyping errors possible when manually entering codes.\nInvalid codes possible if mobile device clock gets out of sync with Salesforce.\n\t\n\nConsiderations:\n\nRequires browser support (limited for U2F).\nUsers could leave key unattended or plugged in all the time.\nOperational overhead for purchasing, stocking, and distributing devices to users.\n\t\n\nConsiderations:\n\nDevice, operating system, and browser must support FIDO2 WebAuthn standard.\nBuilt-in authenticator service must be enabled and set up.\nTied to a single device.\nSupported scanner required for biometric identification.\n\nCost: Free\tCost: Free and paid options\tCost: Starts around $20\tCost: Starts around $25 for biometric peripherals, if needed\nLearn More\tLearn More\tLearn More\tLearn More\n\n* Notes:\n\n‣ Security keys that use the NFC form factor aren’t supported in products built on the Salesforce Platform.\n\n‣ WebAuthn-compatible security keys aren’t supported in non-Chromium versions of the Edge browser.\n\n‣ If you use a U2F security key with products built on the Salesforce Platform, see Update U2F Security Keys to Support WebAuthn Authentication to ensure your key continues to work.\n\n‣ Built-in authenticators are supported in all products built on the Salesforce Platform, Heroku, Marketing Cloud Intelligence, MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, and Tableau Cloud.\n\n‣ If you can’t use a mobile authenticator app, a TOTP desktop authenticator app or browser extension is another option.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
