For more voice and tone suggestions, check out these resources.\n\nSalesforce Voice and Tone Guidelines\nTrailhead: User Engagement\nTrailhead: Writing Style\nTitles\n\nUse keywords that emphasize the purpose and value of the feature or process to users. Avoid excessive exclamation marks.\n\nFor prompts, format your title with imperative phrases.\n\n EXAMPLE\nPROMPT TITLE WITH IMPERATIVE\t EXAMPLE\nPROMPT TITLE WITH NOUN PHRASES\nCreate shortcuts to favorite pages\tFavorites are a way to create shortcuts\nNew feature: Favorites\n\nFor walkthroughs, your title varies with each step.\n\nThe first step of the walkthrough welcomes the user and summarizes the content of the walkthrough.\nThe middle steps can be either instructional to describe how to complete an action or conceptual to provide information that helps users understand the use case, benefit, or purpose.\nThe last step gives users encouragement for taking the walkthrough.\nHeaders (Docked Prompts)\n\nThe header follows the title, so use it to indicate to the user what type of information is in the prompt. For example, Important Changes, New Feature, or List View Tips.\n\nBody Text\n\nElaborate on the title without restating it. Provide more information about the feature or process, mention the problem that the solution solves, or include common use cases.\n\nWrite in a minimal, straightforward style. Include content that’s directly relevant to the current task. Don’t include anything that users must refer to later. Focus on writing content that’s easy to understand and to execute.\n\nFloating and targeted prompts support rich text formatting such as bold, italics, and underline. Docked prompts also support rich text but provide more options, including colors, links, and lists.\n\nFor walkthroughs, the body varies with each step.\n\nThe first step of the walkthrough clearly states the goal and the benefits to the user before they start.\nThe middle steps provide more details about the process or concept.\nThe last step can include next steps or resources to keep the user engaged with the feature\nMedia\n\nKeep users engaged, hold attention, or illustrate a complicated subject with optional images. In a docked prompt, optionally embed a video. For image and video requirements, check out Considerations for In-App Guidance.\n\nButtons\n\nKeep button names consistent. For the optional Action button, the label indicates where users are going before they click.\n\nBUTTON\tRECOMMENDED LABEL\nDismiss\tDismiss\nAction\tTell Me More\n\nThe Action button can also link to a helpful resource that’s accessible from their current environment. When choosing a resource to link to, think about content that helps users complete their current task or is part of the call to action. Avoid linking to resources that require more clicking outside, which can take users further from their current environment.\n\nSEE ALSO\nTypes of In-App Guidance\nCreate Prompts\nCreate Walkthroughs\nConsiderations for Creating In-App Guidance\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
