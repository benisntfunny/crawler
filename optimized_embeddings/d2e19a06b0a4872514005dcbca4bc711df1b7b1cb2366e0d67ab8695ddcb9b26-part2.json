People with read/write access to the record have Collaborator access to the file. People with read-only access to the record have Viewer access to the file.\n\nIf you disable Standard sharing for Knowledge, and the access of the content on a Knowledge record is Set by Record, then the user must have the Modify All Data permission to get collaborator access. The user doesn’t inherit the collaborator access on the file attached to the Knowledge record based on the object-level access.\n\nSet by Library for a file in a library means that access to the file follows access to the library. This setting can’t be changed.\n\nFile owners and collaborators can change file permissions for people and groups from Viewer to Collaborator and conversely. They can also change file permissions for files shared with their company to Viewer, Collaborator, or No Access.\n\nOn the file preview page or from the file actions list, select Share.\nExpand Who Can Access.\nChange file permissions for people and groups using the menu, or click the X next to a person or record to stop sharing the file.\nNOTE\nA file is shared with your company when it's posted:\nTo a feed that all users can see\nTo a profile\nTo a record\nTo a public group\nAll Chatter users in your company are given Viewer permission by default. If you change that permission from Viewer or Collaborator to No Access, the file is no longer shared with the company or with public groups.\nWhen you share a file with someone, they are given Collaborator access by default. When you share a file with a group, the group members are given Viewer access by default. You can change the default access when you share a file for the first time. File owners and collaborators can change access after a file has been shared.\nFile link recipients can only view and download files. They can't be collaborators.\nAdmins can also add the Prevent others from sharing and unsharing option to page layouts, letting users prevent further sharing of the file from the file detail page.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
