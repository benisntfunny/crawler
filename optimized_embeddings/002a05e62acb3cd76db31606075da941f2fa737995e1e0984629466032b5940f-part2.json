When you install and deploy data kits and packages, you add and configure the data model objects (DMOs) that support marketing assets, performance metrics, and regulatory data. Each data kit contains a collection of data bundles, objects, fields, and other settings that make Marketing Cloud Growth work. Each package has its own related setup tasks.\nCreate an Identity Resolution Ruleset for Marketing Cloud Growth\nIdentity resolution is a critical step to organizing and unifying your data. Usually, when your data originates from many systems, it’s modeled and labeled differently in each place. Identity resolution rulesets define the relationships among data model objects (DMOs) and their fields. After you configure these rules, Data Cloud can organize related and duplicate data into unified individual records that marketers can use to target audiences.\nEnsure Compliance with Consent Settings\nMarketing Cloud Growth can help you stay in compliance with regulatory bodies and provide your customers with their preferred experience. These tools help you organize contact details, communication subscriptions, and preference forms.\nActivity Tracking in Marketing Cloud Growth\nTrack visitor activities and engagement across your marketing web pages. Use the data to create more targeted segments and inform your marketing strategy. You can track activity on landing pages hosted by Marketing Cloud and on external websites.\nConfigure Required Email Settings\nTo send emails with Marketing Cloud Growth, you must verify at least one sender email address, provide a physical address to include in your email, and configure DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) authentication.\nSet Up SMS Messages in Marketing Cloud Growth\nWhen you have the SMS messaging add-on, you can create and send SMS messages from Marketing Cloud Growth. Before you can start sending, your business must request and register one or more codes. Short codes and long codes are the numbers associated with incoming and outgoing messages. The registration process can take several weeks, so make sure to plan ahead.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
