The approval process starts with the seller’s registration that can be done by you or the seller.\nCases\nAfter making a purchase, a shopper can open a support case to send questions, complaints, or suggestions directly to you.\nCatalogs and Categories\nA catalog consists of categories and subcategories as defined by your Marketplace organization. After you set up the categories, the seller can match their products to the Marketplace categories or suggest new ones. For a product to be displayed on the storefront shelf, it must be associated with an active category in Commerce Marketplace.\nData Protection and Privacy\nCommerce Marketplace generates and stores shoppers’ personal data and sellers’ data in both Salesforce B2C Commerce and your Salesforce org. Data protection and privacy regulations can require you and your company to delete shoppers’ personal data and sellers’ data when requested, or when it's no longer necessary to keep it. Also, when requested, prepare and pack up the data you’ve received from shoppers and sellers to work toward complying with various data protection and privacy regulations.\nImport Settings\nTo make the implementation of the Marketplace more agile, you can set up an import component for some objects in the Marketplace and the Seller Portal. An import component helps you and the seller make large-scale updates of categories, price, stock, and product in two file formats (CSV and XLSX).\nInventory\nWhen a seller updates their inventory, you can access that information. You can view or modify the entry of each Stock Keeping Unit that the seller registers to inform shoppers whether a product is available for purchase or is temporarily unavailable. When a seller updates their inventory, you can access that information. You can view or modify the entry of each Stock Keeping Unit that the seller registers to inform shoppers whether a product is available for purchase or is temporarily unavailable.\nOrders\nWhen a shopper makes a purchase, a record is created. This record contains items purchased, number of units, delivery address values, commission values, and other important information so that the order can be managed by marketplace operators and sellers. The consolidation of this information is carried out in objects known as Marketplace Order and Seller Order.\nPrice Books\nIn the Commerce Marketplace you have access to Default, Sale, and Customer Group price books. Each price book provides pricing information for products that the Marketplace operator and seller make available in the storefront. Also, in a price book you can find price book entries that contain the price ranges associated with each product. The Default price book contains the base prices for products, which are displayed on the storefront as Price From. The Sale price book lists the sale price for the products in the Default price book. A seller can have only one Default price book and one Sale price book, but you can have multiple Customer Group price books. A Customer Group price book contains the discount prices that are presented only to customers who buy the product on a large scale.\nPromotions\nBoth sellers and marketplace operators can offer shoppers product promotions and shipping promotions. You can create a promotion for a specific product or all products, offer coupons, determine the active period, and establish the type of discount. A promotion is always tied to a product.\nProducts\nTo display a product in the storefront, you add it as a record type within the Marketplace Product object. Commerce Marketplace has two record types for the Marketplace Product object: Seller Imported and Marketplace Item. The seller creates the Seller Imported record type in the Seller Portal and sends it to you for approval and integration.\nReports\nBy creating different reports, you can have a written record or summary of the various activities performed in your Marketplace.\nThe Seller Portal\nThe Seller Portal is a business management tool that connects sellers and Marketplace operators. As the Marketplace operator, you determine the resources that the seller can access based on your license type. To allow a seller full access to the seller portal, you grant them a Community Plus license and customize the portal in Experience Builder.\nShipping Methods\nShipping methods are based on the delivery service, shipping rates, and time frame of the companies that the Marketplace and seller work with. Sellers can use either the default shipping method or offer their own.\nCommerce Marketplace for Salesforce Commerce\nConnect the Commerce Marketplace app to your existing Salesforce Commerce to let third-party sellers offer their products in your Salesforce Commerce storefront for a fee. Buyers can view the products of the third-party seller and compare prices. The Commerce Marketplace app is available as a managed package that’s installed on top of Salesforce Commerce. It includes additional Marketplace entities, storefront components, and integration components. The app also offers a multi-marketplace solution for creating and managing different Marketplaces to diversify your revenue stream and increase your market share, data insights, and opportunities for cross-promotion.\nPatch Notes for Commerce Marketplace Winter’ 23\nSeveral patch releases are available for updating the existing Commerce Marketplace. All patches contain fixes that are automatically upgraded. Each patch release is also cumulative, and contains all the fixes from previous Commerce Marketplace Winter ’23 patches. You don't need to complete any previous upgrade steps to install this particular patch build.\nPatch Notes for Commerce Marketplace Spring’ 23\nThese patch releases are available for Commerce Marketplace. All patches contain fixes that are automatically upgraded when a new Commerce Marketplace version is installed. Each patch also contains fixes from the previous Commerce Marketplace Winter ’23 (version 2.49) patches, so you don’t need to complete previous upgrades to install this patch build.\nPatch Notes for Commerce Marketplace Summer’ 23\nThese patch releases are available for Commerce Marketplace. All patches contain fixes that are automatically upgraded when a new Commerce Marketplace version is installed. Each patch also contains fixes from the previous Commerce Marketplace Spring ’23 (version 2.59) patches, so you don’t need to complete previous upgrades to install this patch build.\nPatch Notes for Commerce Marketplace Spring’ 24\nSeveral patch releases are available for updating the existing Commerce Marketplace. All patches contain fixes that are automatically upgraded. Each patch release is also cumulative, and contains all the fixes from previous Commerce Marketplace Winter ’23 patches.
