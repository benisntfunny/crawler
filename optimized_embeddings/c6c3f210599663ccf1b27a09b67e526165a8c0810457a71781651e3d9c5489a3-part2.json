You can choose My Domain to use a Salesforce subdomain or configure your own custom domain for hosting content. You can also create a tracking domain if you plan to use SMS messaging. Configuring DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) authentication for sending emails is required.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nSalesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\nSalesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition and the Salesforce Message Credits - SMS add-on\nDOMAIN SETTING\tDESCRIPTION\nMy Domain\tMy Domain allows you to showcase your company’s brand with a custom subdomain name in your Salesforce org login and application URLs.\nCustom Domain\tA custom domain gives further control over URLs that are visible to your customers. When you add a custom domain in Marketing Cloud Growth, we recommend that you serve content with the Salesforce Content Delivery Network (CDN). To track activity on a landing page that uses a custom domain, add a custom URL for that domain in Setup and define the path as /lp.\nAuthentication (DKIM)\t\n\nDKIM is a method of email authentication that protects email recipients from messages that use spoofed email addresses. It can improve the deliverability of your emails. Because it requires you to store a unique identifier on your web domain, setting up DKIM typically requires help from your IT or web administrator.\n\nDKIM authentication is required to send email with Marketing Cloud Growth.\n\n\nTracking Domain\tA tracking domain monitors message opens and link clicks. The default tracking domain is owned by Salesforce, but you can also configure a domain that your organization owns.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
