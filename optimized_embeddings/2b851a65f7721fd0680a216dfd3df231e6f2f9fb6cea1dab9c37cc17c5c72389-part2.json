Use Chat and Messaging to provide instant conversation to your customers through web chat and Facebook Messenger. Use Macros to complete multi-step tasks with a single click.\n\nDivvy Up Work On Your Team with Routing\nUse Omni-Channel to route work items (like cases, leads, chats, and messages) to the best-fit person on your team based on your team’s availability and the priority of the work. The most important work items are pushed to your team first.\nOffer Live Customer Support with Chat and Messaging\nOffer your customers instant conversation with web chat and Facebook Messenger for Essentials. Chats and messages are delivered to team members alongside their other work in Salesforce, so they can handle cases, chats, messages, and everything else side by side.\nAutomate Your Tasks with Macros\nA macro automates a common process so your team can help customers with fewer clicks.\nLearn Best Practices for B2C Businesses\nIf you’re running a small business that works with customers directly, you’ve definitely got a lot going on.

This behavior doesn’t mean they’re no longer interested; it’s just time to remind them about your great products and service.\nManage Your Contacts with These Best Practices\nStoring and managing contact data in your CRM means that you get to know your customer and understand the timeline of your relationship with the customer. You also get a big-picture view of how all your customers benefit your business.\nAutomate Your Business Routines\nSave time by automating your business practices.
