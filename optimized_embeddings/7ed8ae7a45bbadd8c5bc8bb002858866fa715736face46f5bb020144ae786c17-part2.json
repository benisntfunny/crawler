Because LLMs are trained by other organizations, the output isn’t always what you expect. If the output doesn’t meet your expectations, you can generate a new output by starting over. The generated output from the previous attempt remains in the email composer and the new output is appended.\n\nIMPORTANT This tool uses generative AI, which is known to include inaccurate or harmful responses. Before sharing externally, review the output for accuracy and safety. You assume responsibility for the output when sharing.\nCredit Usage and Tracking\n\nSales Emails charges only for the activity you use. Learn how your sales reps interact with Einstein and track your usage against your subscription allowance. Only orgs with Sales Emails enabled and sales reps with the Einstein Sales Emails permission set can contribute to your credit usage.\n\nFor each Einstein generative AI feature, credit usage depends on the number of LLM requests, the size of the prompt, and the size of the generated outputs. For Sales Emails, a request is created each time a sales rep uses Einstein to draft an email. The exact credit usage depends on the size of the email output.\n\nTo learn more or get updates on your Sales Emails credit usage, contact your Salesforce account executive.\n\nSEE ALSO\nEinstein Generative AI\nConsiderations for Einstein Generative AI Sales Emails\nSet Up Sales Emails\nSet Up Einstein Sales Emails for Partners\nPrompt Builder\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
