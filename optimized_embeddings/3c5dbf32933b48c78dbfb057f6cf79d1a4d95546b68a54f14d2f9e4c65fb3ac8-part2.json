High-assurance security sessions are different in Lightning Experience and users with a standard assurance session are blocked from reports and dashboards. Two-factor authentication isn’t available for the AccessResource event type in Lightning Experience.\n\nSharing Settings\n\nLightning Experience respects your organization’s sharing rules. The Sharing Settings page is available in Setup in Lightning Experience.\n\nSession Security Levels\n\nHigh-assurance security sessions are different in Lightning Experience.\n\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nHigh-assurance sessions\t\t\t\n\nIf your org sets a policy that requires a high-assurance session to access reports and dashboards, users with a standard assurance session are blocked from reports and dashboards in Lightning Experience. Also, the Reports and Dashboards items don’t appear in the navigation menu. In Lightning Experience, you can’t raise the session level to high assurance by redirecting the user to complete two-factor authentication.\n\nAs a workaround, users with a standard assurance session can log out and log in again using an authentication method that is defined as high assurance by your organization. They then have access to reports and dashboards.\n\nSession Privilege Levels\n\nSession privilege levels are maintained in Lightning Experience, with some differences.\n\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nSession privilege levels\t\t\tSessions obtained in a Lightning Experience context, by using $Api.Session_ID or GETSESSIONID(), have similar privileges to the Lightning session. As with the Lightning session, you can't use these session IDs to make API calls.\nTransaction Security\n\nThe AccessResource event type is available in Lightning Experience with some differences.\n\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nAccessResource event type\t\t\tTwo-factor authentication isn’t available for the AccessResource event type. Use the Block action instead.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
