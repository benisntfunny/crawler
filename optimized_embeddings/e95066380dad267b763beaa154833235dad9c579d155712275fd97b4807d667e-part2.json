Put your change management strategy to work to help users understand the importance of MFA and to deliver a smooth onboarding experience. Your goal is to engage and educate everyone with communication, training, and even some marketing.\n\nKick off the change management activities that you identified for your project, and keep them going until all of your users have successfully adopted MFA. We recommend a multipronged strategy with these types of activities:\n\nCommunications and promotional campaigns\nTraining\nLaunch day onboarding and support\nTIP For help with these activities, check out the downloadable MFA Rollout Pack. It includes customizable templates to help you run an email campaign, train users on MFA, and support them on your launch day with onboarding templates.\nEngage Users with Communication and Promotional Campaigns\n\nCommunicate early and often with your Salesforce users, and use multiple channels so that you’re sure to reach everyone. Explain what multi-factor authentication (MFA) is, when you’re launching it, what users must do to be ready, and where they can find instructions and support. Explain why your users should care by reinforcing the idea that MFA is an important safeguard for their accounts, their data, and their customers’ well being. By establishing these details early in your project, you can head off user resistance and avoid adoption blockers.\n\nHere are a few ideas for engaging your users.\n\nCommunication Forum\tCreate a central place, such as a Slack channel or Chatter group, for announcements, questions and answers, and peer collaboration. This is also a great place to share regular updates on your launch schedule.\nMarketing Campaigns\tBuild awareness by running a week-long email campaign that sells users on the value of MFA and provides tips and tricks so they’re ready for your launch day. This is also a great channel for explaining how to register verification methods and log in with MFA.\nVisual Reminders\tReinforce awareness by putting posters in hallways and break rooms. Develop a theme or catch phrase that engages and empowers users — something like “Security Starts With You!” or “Turn the Lock All the Way With MFA.” Do you have a creative side? Consider ways to make the posters pop with color or eye-catching imagery.\nTIP Include external users who access your Salesforce environment, such as partners, contractors, and call center services, in all communications and campaigns.\nTrain Users on MFA Fundamentals\n\nWhen a user logs in after MFA has been enabled, a series of prompts guide them through the steps to register and use a verification method. But don’t rely on this experience alone. Providing some formal training on MFA fundamentals is important for a successful rollout.\n\nThere are several training approaches you can take.\n\nOn-Demand Training\tCreate resources, such as a video, that users can access on their own time. Or, ask users to complete the User Authentication module in Trailhead.\nIn-Person Training\tSet up real-time training opportunities, like webinars or lunch-and-learn sessions.\n\nCover these details in your training materials:\n\nWhat MFA is and why it’s important for your company and your customers.\nThe verification methods that you’re supporting in your implementation, and the steps users must take to register them.\nHow to log in using each of verification method that you’re supporting.\nHow long a user’s session stays active after they log in, and how to re-authenticate if their session expires.\nWhere to get help if users have problems registering a method, logging in, or if they forget or lose their verification method.\nDevelop Onboarding Materials and Plan Your Launch Day\n\nTraining is important, but don’t expect users to remember everything they learned ahead of time. Come launch day, users benefit from simple resources that explain and expand on the in-app registration prompts. Onboarding materials go a long way in getting people up and running (and reduce calls to your support team).\n\nConsider creating a quick start web page or a laminated cheat sheet that you can distribute to users shortly before enabling MFA. Focus on the step-by-step instructions for acquiring and registering a verification method, then using it to log in. Make sure that it’s clear how users can get help if they get stuck or confused.\n\nDevelop processes and documentation to quickly resolve any problems that users encounter on your launch day.\n\nDeflect calls to your support team by creating self-help materials, including troubleshooting information for the most likely problems that users might encounter on your launch day.\nPlan to hold office hours or to set up a dedicated, onsite help desk for the day. Make sure the people who staff these resources are trained and can access your MFA troubleshooting documentation. If you do a dry run simulating your launch day, the actual event should go more smoothly.\nConsider establishing an SOS process for execs and business users who need priority help if they run into problems.\n\nFinally, think about having a little fun on your launch day. With some creativity and a little budget, you can make your go-live an engaging event. Here are some ideas:\n\nHave a raffle with prizes, such as gift cards, a free day off, or lunch with an executive.\nHost a launch party with cupcakes.\nHand out swag or branded items.\nHold a contest where the first number of users to successfully log in with MFA receive a prize. Congratulate the winners in a public company forum. People are motivated by recognition and prizes, no matter how small or inexpensive!\nSEE ALSO\nDetermine Your MFA Change Management Strategy\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
