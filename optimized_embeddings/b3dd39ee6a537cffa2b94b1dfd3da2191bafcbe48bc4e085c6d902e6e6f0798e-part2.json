Here are some resources to help your end users get the most out of the Salesforce mobile app and address some common situations that differ from the Salesforce full site experience.\n\nDownload and Log In to the Salesforce Mobile App\nMost users have access to the Salesforce mobile app by default. It's easy to get started.\nSalesforce Mobile App and Password Manager Apps\nGood security practices require long, complex passwords. But typing long, complex passwords on small mobile keyboards is error prone and frustrating. If your org uses password management, your Salesforce for iOS users can use a password manager app to simplify the login process down to a few taps.\nSalesforce Mobile App and Biometric ID\nBiometric ID is a secure and convenient way to access the Salesforce mobile app. On capable devices, you can unlock the app with touch or face authentication, instead of a PIN.\nOpen Links with One Tap\nWhen Salesforce mobile app users tap Lightning URL and Chatter notification links on their phones, they’re taken directly to the mobile app. Learn more about which URL types are supported.\nConfigure Deep Linking for the Salesforce Mobile App\nUse supported URL schemes for the Salesforce mobile application for Android and iOS to launch Salesforce from a third-party or web application. You can customize a URL scheme to perform a specific action when Salesforce launches. For example, if a user receives an email about a feed post, you can create a link for the user to tap to view the post in the Salesforce Mobile app.\nThe Enhanced Contacts Experience (Beta)\nEnhanced Contacts (beta) is an upgraded experience for interacting with contact lists and records, optimized for phone and tablet use and included with existing licenses.\nEnable Mobile Home for iOS and Android\nMobile Home is a set of configurable, dynamic cards that show personalized information for your users. When users open the Mobile Home page, they can see their reports, recent records, favorites, and more. Each card shows information that’s based on what users view in Salesforce. Your users can also easily rearrange, add, and remove cards to customize Mobile Home.\nManaging Your Day with Today in Salesforce for iOS and Android\nToday in Salesforce for iOS and Salesforce for Android shows key information for reps on the go. Admins can add the Today item to the navigation menu of Lightning apps and the Mobile Only app.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
