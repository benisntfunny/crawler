However, associated records, sharing rules, and manual sharing can also affect the flow’s visibility.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Salesforce Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Marketing Cloud Growth Edition\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo view all flows in the Flows Lightning app regardless of sharing settings:\tManage Flow or View Flows and View All Non-Admin Flows\nTo view flows owned by or shared with you in the Flows Lightning app:\tView Flows\nTo create and edit all flows in the Flows Lightning app, regardless of sharing settings:\tManage Flow or Create or Edit Flows, View Flows and View All Non-Admin Flow\nTo create and edit flows owned by or shared with you with Read/Write access in the Flows Lightning app:\tCreate or Edit Flows and View Flows\nIMPORTANT\n\nIf you’re familiar with creating flows in Flow Builder from Setup, be aware that campaign flow sharing settings are different. Flows created in Setup remain visible to everyone who has View Setup and Manage Flow permissions, and you can’t share flows or associate records.\n\nWho Can See a Campaign Flow on the Flows Page?\n\nIn Marketing Cloud Growth, a campaign flow without sharing rules is private and visible only to its owner, Salesforce admins, and users with View All Non-Setup Flows or Manage Flow permissions. However, when you add an associated record to a campaign flow, the flow inherits that record’s sharing settings. If you remove or delete the record in the campaign flow’s Associated Record field, the flow’s sharing settings revert to the sharing rule defined for that flow. If the campaign flow doesn’t have any defined sharing rules, it reverts to private.\n\nRELATIONSHIP\tSHARING OUTCOME\nA campaign is available in a flow’s Associated Record field.\tThe flow inherits the campaign’s sharing settings.\nA campaign is removed from a flow’s Associated Record field.\tThe flow reverts to previously defined sharing rules. When there aren’t any rules, it becomes private to its owner, Salesforce admins, and users with View All Non-Setup Flows or Manage Flow permissions.\nA campaign that’s used in a flow’s Associated Record field is deleted.\tThe flow reverts to previously defined sharing rules. When there aren’t any rules, it becomes private to its owner, Salesforce admins, and users with View All Non-Setup Flows or Manage Flow permissions.\nA previously deleted campaign is restored from the Recycle Bin.\tThe flow inherits the campaign’s sharing settings.\nHow Do You Share a Campaign Flow?\n\nAn admin can group campaign flows into categories and subcategories and create sharing rules in Sharing Settings. After an admin creates the sharing rules in Sharing Settings, users add the category and subcategory to the flow record’s detail page to apply them.\n\nAlternatively, users can use manual sharing to share an individual campaign flow from the flow’s record detail page. After they click Sharing, users can choose whether to share the flow with other users, public groups, roles, or roles and subordinates.\n\nShare Campaign Flows with Categories\nOrganize campaign flows into categories and subcategories. After an admin creates criteria-based sharing rules that control access to campaign flows, users can add categories and subcategories to apply the rules.\nManually Share a Campaign Flow Record\nFrom a flow record, you can share a campaign flow with users, groups, roles, or roles and subordinates. This functionality is available on Marketing Cloud Growth campaign flows, and is visible from the Flows tab or Flows Lightning app.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
