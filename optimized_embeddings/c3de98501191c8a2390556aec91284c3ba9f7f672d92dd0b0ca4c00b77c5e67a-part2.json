If you turn off Chatter in Lightning Experience, global search stays on.\n\nChatter Feeds\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nPosts with or without a file attachment\t\t\tYou have more options for formatting posts and adding attachments to posts in Lightning Experience. The Chatter publisher offers more controls for styling and adding content. Enhancements include inline images, hyperlinks, link to record, and code snippets.\nQuestions\t\t\t\nWhen you ask a question that’s similar to one that’s been asked in Salesforce Classic, auto-complete options are presented. In Lightning Experience, no auto-complete options are presented.\nThe Chatter publisher in Lightning Experience offers more controls for styling and adding content to question details. Enhancements include inline images, hyperlinks, link to record, and code snippets.\nIn Experience Cloud sites, you can configure question components like the Ask Button, to show related content that can help a site member find their solution. Related content can include similar questions and Knowledge articles.\n\nThanks\t\t\tAlthough Thanks as a feature isn’t available in Lightning Experience, you can thank someone in a post. You can make it more special by decorating the post with an inline image that you choose.\nFilter feeds\t\t\tOn any feed, the sort and filter options vary, depending on how your administrator sets up Salesforce and the feed that you’re viewing. For a detailed breakdown of the filters and sorting options that are available in each experience, see Feed Sort and Filter Options.\nApprovals\t\t\tIn Salesforce Classic, users can see and respond to approvals in their Chatter feeds. In Lightning Experience, users are notified about approvals in their in-app notifications. From a notification, they can navigate to the Approval Request tab, where they can respond to requests.\nTopics\t\t\t\nAfter a topic is added to a post, it’s permanently associated with the post in the system. This association remains, even if you remove the topic by editing the post.\nThere isn’t a topic list view on the Chatter home page.\nThe topic detail page doesn’t have a publisher.\n\nHighlighted search results\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, when a user runs a search on a feed, search terms aren’t highlighted in the results.\nChatter messages\t\t\t\nMuting\t\t\t\n\nWhen you mute in Salesforce Classic, the item disappears from its feed. You can see it in the Muted feed.\n\nWhen you mute in Lightning Experience, the muted item stays in the feed where it was posted, but it disappears from the What I Follow feed. You don't receive any more notifications about the item.\n\nIf you want to refer to that item again, you can search for it in its source feed. You can also copy and save its detail-view URL.\n\n\nTags\t\t\t\nFollowing\t\t\t\nIn Salesforce Classic, you can see the records that you're following on the Overview tab of your profile. This view isn’t available in Lightning Experience.\nIn Lightning Experience, you can't follow or unfollow records in a list view or check record status.\nIn Lightning Experience, you can’t see who else is following a record.\nIn Salesforce Classic, you can’t follow something by adding it to a stream.\n\nRich Text Editor\t\t\tIn the Spring ’20 edition of Lightning Experience on iPad Safari, check your text editors for rich text editor support. For example, check for support in a feeds publisher. If you don’t have rich text editor support—you can’t add an emoji or a hyperlink—you’re using an older, unsupported editor. Contact Salesforce Support to upgrade to the latest editor.\nPeople and Profiles\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nAll User list\t\t\t\nChatter Influence\t\t\t\nLimiting visibility of Contact and About fields to employees, external users, or public (guest) users\t\t\t\nAdd new actions (administrator)\t\t\t\nEdit profile for Chatter External licensees\t\t\tProfile refers to the external user’s personal profile page.\nRecently Talked About topics\t\t\tThe Trending Topics area on the Chatter tab in Lightning Experience shows the topics that are being discussed right now in Chatter.\nProfile photo\t\t\tYour Experience Cloud site profile photo in Lightning Experience is larger and displays at a higher resolution than in Salesforce Classic. Profile photos uploaded in Salesforce Classic don’t look great in Lightning Experience until you upload the photo in Lightning Experience.\nGroups\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nAdd Record action in customer groups\t\t\tIn groups that include external members, such as customers, you can’t add records using the Add Record action. You can’t add records even when an administrator includes the action in the group publisher.\nUse Invite People to invite customers to join groups using their email addresses\t\t\tInstead, you must create users for these customers. Then use the Add Member action to add them to the group.\nAccess Chatter-wide notification settings from the group notification settings\t\t\tIn Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience, you can edit your personal Chatter settings through your personal Settings. Click your profile avatar at the top of the page, and click Settings (Lightning Experience) or My Settings (Salesforce Classic).\nRecently Talked About topics\t\t\t\nRemove files from the group files list\t\t\tIn Lightning Experience, you can delete group files that you own from the page that you see when you click View All on the group’s files list.\nRecommendations\nFEATURE OR SETTING\tAVAILABLE WITH DIFFERENCES\tNOT AVAILABLE\tNOTES\nRecommendations\t\t\t\nIn Lightning Experience, Recommendations appear only on the Chatter home page.\nFiles and records aren’t recommended.\nSEE ALSO\nCompare Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
