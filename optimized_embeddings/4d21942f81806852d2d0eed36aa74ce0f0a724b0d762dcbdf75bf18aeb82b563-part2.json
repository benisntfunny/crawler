The global model uses anonymous data from many Salesforce customers. When you accumulate enough lead data, Einstein builds a scoring model with your data and uses the model with the better results.\n\nEncourage reps to add as much data to their leads as possible. When leads have more data, Einstein Lead Scoring generates better insights.\nReps must have read access to the Company, Phone, and Email fields on leads.\nDon’t install Apex classes that reference the ScoreIntelligence field until after you enable Einstein Lead Scoring and receive the notification that enablement is complete. Otherwise, references to the ScoreIntelligence field are invalid.\nEinstein does not use encrypted lead fields in lead score analysis. When you turn encryption on or off for a field, Einstein includes the change in the next analysis. Einstein reanalyzes your leads approximately every 10 days.\nIf you have over a million scored leads, the Einstein Lead Scoring Analytics app can stop working. The exact number depends on your org’s configuration.\nIf you turned on Einstein Lead Scoring in Spring ’20 or earlier, you no longer need the Lead filter in the Einstein Lead Scoring Analytics app. To remove the filter, open the Data Manager in Analytics Studio and then click Connect. Click Lead, then Continue. Remove the ScoreIntelligence.Score >= 0 filter text and save your changes.\nScoring Leads in Segments\nData requirements for scoring all leads together also apply to individual lead segments.\nEach time you change Einstein Lead Scoring settings, Einstein updates the segment IDs for each lead segment, even if you score all your leads in a single segment. During these updates, some data in the CRM Analytics Lead Scoring Dashboard, including lead conversion rates, can be incorrect until Einstein updates your scores based on the new settings.\nWhen using segments or any other custom lead scoring settings, any new fields added to leads must be added manually to the list of included fields for each segment if you Einstein to consider them during scoring.\nUsing Filters\n\nIf you create lead segments using field filters, be aware of what happens when you delete or deactivate picklist field values.\n\nIf you delete a picklist value from a standard field, you can’t use the value to set up a field filter.\nIf you deactivate a picklist value from a standard field, you can’t use it to set up a field filter. However, existing field filters based on that value still work with lead records that contain the deactivated value.\nIf you create a field filter using a standard field value and then delete that filtered value from the field, the filter still functions correctly. However, the field appears in Setup with a blank value.\nIf you delete a picklist value from a custom field, it still appears in Setup, but any filter created with that value doesn’t function.\nIf you deactivate a picklist value from a custom field, it can still be used to set up a field filter.\nSEE ALSO\nEnable Einstein Lead Scoring\nEinstein Lead Scoring\nUnderstand How Einstein Scores Your Leads\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
