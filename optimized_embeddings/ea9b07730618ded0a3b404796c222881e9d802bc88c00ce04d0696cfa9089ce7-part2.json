Many objects and fields are tracked by default, but you can further customize feed tracking to include or exclude specific objects and fields.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience\n\n\nAvailable in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Contact Manager, Developer, and Database.com Editions\n\nThe Account, Case, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, and User objects aren’t available in Database.com.\n\nSalesforce Connect external objects are available in Developer Edition and, for an extra cost, in Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions.\n\n\n\nUSER PERMISSIONS\nNEEDED\nTo customize fields tracked in feeds:\t“Customize Application”\nTo view the feed tracking setup page:\t“View Setup and Configuration”\n\nYou can configure feed tracking for users, Chatter groups, topics, custom objects, and external objects. You can also set up feed tracking for the following standard objects:\n\naccounts\narticle types\nassets\ncampaigns\ncases\ncontacts\ncontracts\ndashboards\nevents\nleads\nopportunities\nproducts\nreports\nsolutions\ntasks\nNOTE In Lightning Experience, most objects don't show a Chatter tab unless feed tracking is enabled for the object. The only exceptions are Group, Site, and User objects. The What I Follow feed shows updates to the tracked fields on the people and objects that a user follows. There’s one exception. Updates that report a user’s own changes to a tracked field appear in the user’s profile feed, but not in What I Follow.\nFrom Setup, enter Feed Tracking in the Quick Find box, then select Feed Tracking.\nSelect an object.\nSelect Enable Feed Tracking.\nYou must have the required user permissions to see the Enable Feed Tracking checkbox.\nSelect up to 20 of the object’s fields to track.\n\nYou can’t select fields for external objects or article types. These standard field types can't be tracked:\n\nAuto-number, formula, and roll-up summary fields\nEncrypted and read-only system fields\nThe Expected Revenue field on opportunities\nThe Solution Title and Solution Details fields on solutions. These fields appear only for translated solutions in organizations with multilingual solutions enabled\nIf you have actions in the publisher enabled, you see the All Related Objects option. To show feed items when related objects are created, select this checkbox.\nTo enable actions in the publisher, in the Setup Quick Find box, enter Chatter, and select Chatter Settings. Under Actions in the Publisher, select Enable Actions in the Publisher.\nSave your changes.\nWhen a value in a tracked field changes, users see a notification about the change in the appropriate feed.\nSEE ALSO\nFeed Tracking\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
