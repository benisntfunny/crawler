The list includes their access level and an explanation and shows every user who has access that’s greater than the org-wide default settings.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience (not available in all orgs)\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nSome sharing rules specify access to an object and its associated objects. For sharing rules that specify access for associated object records, the given access level applies to that sharing rule only. For example, if an account sharing rule specifies Private as the access level for associated contacts, a user can access associated contacts via other means. These means include org-wide defaults, the Modify All Data or View All Data permission, or the Modify All or View All permission for contacts.\n\nTo display a list of users who have access, click Sharing Hierarchy from the Action Menu on the desired record.\n\nIf you don’t see the Sharing Hierarchy option, and you have the right permissions, make sure it’s added to the page layout.\n\nNOTE In editions that support restriction rules, this list can include users who don’t have access due to a restriction rule.\nTo see the reason the user has or doesn’t have access to the record, click View next to a user’s name. When you click View, all applicable sharing reasons appear. If a restriction rule blocks access to the record, a message is shown to confirm that access is blocked.
