Industry rules and regulations are in a constant state of flux. Licenses need to renewed, fees need to be collected.\n\nWith custom-built objects and JSON-based services, Vlocity's collection of network management features help you create a robust and easily manageable provider system of record. \n\nProvider Network Management Pillars\n\nVlocity has broken down the network management workflow and maintenance into six major tasks:\n\nRecruiting: Identify and recruit the best health service providers into their network. The provider recruiter leads these business processes as part of the health plan recruiting team.\nCredentialing: Process provider applications and verify their credentials before they join the network. The credentialing specialist leads these businesses processes as part of the health plan credentialing team.\nContracting: Establish and agree on contracts, health plans need draft contracts and provider fee schedules. The contract specialist leads these business processes as part of the health plan contract recruiting team.\nOnboarding: Bring service providers into the health plan for optimal success and retention, health plans design and deliver onboarding programs to get providers on board the network. The provider onboarding specialist leads these business processes as part of the health plan onboarding team.\nSelf-servicing: Support providers by enabling access to claims, payments, and various types of self-servicing, including general support issues. The provider relations specialist leads these business processes as part of the health plan servicing team.\nAdministering: Provide members with timely access to a sufficient number of in-network providers according to service-level targets. Adequacy involves the analysis of the provider network for adequacy and deficiencies to optimise the network and support continuous improvement.\nIMPORTANT Provider Network Management is retired in Vlocity Health and Vlocity Insurance Summer '22 and moved to Health Cloud.\n\nFor more information, see Set Up and Manage Your Network of Providers and Vlocity Objects Available in Health Cloud.\n\nProvider Network Objects and Services\nProvider Network Management helps you manage the doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers in your network that are part of health insurance plans. This includes such things as recruitment, registration, licensing, certification, and provider fees.\nProvider Directory Management (Retired)\nVlocity has a variety of features that are used to add to and maintain a provider directory, for both provider organizations and individual providers.\nProvider Directory UI Setup (Retired)\nThe Provider Directory UI is an LWC component that is used to perform common tasks for provider contacts, provider demographics, such as address, phone, fax, and specialty, licensing, credentialing, and privileging information; hospital affiliation; rate information; and contracting terms.\nProvider Recruiting\nHealth plans use the internal tools to manage recruiting processes, such as sourcing the list of providers for recruitment, creating campaigns and leads, creating health plan internal IDs, and creating provider portal login credentials. Providers use the external provider portal to register with a health plan, view the status of their application, and more.\nProvider Credentialing\nHealth plans use Health Cloud internal tools to manage credentialing processes, such as populating demographic information, processing provider applications, and verifying license and education credentials. Providers use the Health Cloud external provider portal to complete and check the status of their application with the health plan.\nProvider Contracting\nHealth plans use Health Cloud internal tools to manage contracting processes, such as checking entry criteria and whether credentialing is started or completed, creating a tiered network, creating and generating contracts and fee schedules, and initiating the negotiation of the contract. Providers use the Health Cloud provider portal to review, negotiate, and sign the contract.\nProvider Onboarding\nHealth plans use Health Cloud internal tools to manage onboarding processes, such as checking provider entry criteria, configuring provider capabilities in their provider portal, and tracking onboarding progress. Providers use the Health Cloud provider portal to access forms and onboarding documents, manage marketing campaigns, maintain their provider and practice details, and use other self-servicing options related to onboarding.\nProvider Self-Servicing\nHealth plans use Health Cloud internal tools to manage servicing processes, such as checking entry criteria during and after onboarding and resolving provider inquiries through their portal. Providers use the Health Cloud provider portal to self-serve, for example, to access claims and payment systems, search for other providers, view appeals and grievances, re-attest data, and maintain their professional and practice details.\nProvider Administering\nHealth plans use Health Cloud internal tools to manage adequacy processes, such as checking entry criteria and the provider directory, reviewing CMS adequacy assessments, analyzing provider participation, maintaining the provider directory, and identifying providers for recredentialing and contract renewal. Providers use their Health Cloud external provider portal to maintain a roster/profile, re-attest data, and recredential.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
