After you choose the type of a decision matrix, you can't change the type.\n\nCreate a Standard Decision Matrix Manually\nIf a decision matrix has only a few rows of data, creating the matrix manually is easier. When you create a decision matrix, the matrix's first version is created by default.\nCreate or Modify Decision Matrices by Using CSV Files\nUse CSV files to create or update decision matrices to save time and effort, especially if you're dealing with sizable data. Create the CSV file in the specified format to successfully add data to a decision matrix version.\nCreate a Version of a Standard Decision Matrix\nCreating a version of an existing decision matrix is quicker than creating a matrix from nothing. You can create a new version from a matrix version that has at least one input and one output columns.\nCreate a Decision Matrix Version from an Existing Version\nTo copy all the data from a selected decision matrix version to a new version easily and quickly, create the version from an existing matrix version.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
