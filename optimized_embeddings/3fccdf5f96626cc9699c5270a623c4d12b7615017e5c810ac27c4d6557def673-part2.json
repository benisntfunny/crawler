The template configuration creates a CRM Analytics app, an Einstein Discovery model, and preconfigured recipes based on the settings defined in the template configuration.\nSelect an Object for Training and Scoring\nSelect a standard or custom object with data to train your model and get predictions.\nSelect a Prediction Duration and Historical Datasets\nYou can generate prediction of an event happening during a specific time period. The model determines historical trends based on the datasets that you provide.\nAdd a Dataset to Fine-Tune Your Predictions\nTo analyze your data better, you can optionally include input features that are in a CRM Analytics dataset.\nDefine the Target for the Prediction\nDefine the variable to use as your model’s primary focus for analysis and predictions. The scoring model uncovers relationships between the input features and your target variable, and provides insights about maximizing or minimizing your target variable.\nSelect Input Features to Get Accurate Predictions\nAn input feature is a field value that can influence prediction. You can select input features from a CRM Analytics dataset, a predefined set of fields, or from the object that you selected for training and scoring.\nSave Assets to Debug Analytics App Installation Failures\nSave your CRM Analytics app assets within the app to maintain access to the assets even if the analytics app installation fails. Use the saved assets to easily debug app installation failures.\nFilter Your Training and Scoring Datasets\nFocus your predictions on a specific subset of the object data by defining filter conditions. Get more useful predictions by excluding records irrelevant to your prediction. Ensure that you have sufficient records in your training and scoring datasets by counting the records. Filtering is optional. You can use the complete dataset for training and scoring.\nStore Predictions in Records\nView your generated predictions contextually by storing them in records. To write back a prediction, select a preconfigured output connector and then select an object and field to store the prediction. You can write back predictions only if you’ve trained and deployed the model for a template configuration.\nShow Real-Time Predictions and Next Best Action Recommendations by Using AI Accelerator\nShow prediction scores, suggestions and insights about prediction scores, and Next Best Action recommendations for your batch and real-time use cases by creating an AI Accelerator use case. Customize the configuration of the AI Accelerator use case by defining your own feature extraction settings and Einstein Discovery model. You can create an AI Accelerator use case only if you’ve trained and deployed the model for a template configuration.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
