Since record pages are easier to customize in Lightning Experience, make a few quick updates to improve user productivity.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nYou can add and edit record pages to fit the workflow.\n\nGive users access to record information at a glance with a customized highlights panel (1).\nMove actions from the dropdown to make them more accessible from the highlights panel (2).\nHelp users visualize their progress by adding the Path component if it’s not already there (3).\nThe first tab users see on their record is the one set as the default for their record page (4). Save your users clicks by setting their favorite tab as the default.\nThe Related List component takes up a lot of room. Give users more space for the content they care about by changing the way they view related lists.\nView all related lists as quick links with the Related List Quick Links component (5).\nFocus on one related list by adding a Related List - Single component (6).\nNext Steps: Customize Your Pages\nGet familiar with standard Lightning page components.\nUse the Lightning App Builder to build custom record pages for your users.\nChange the number of actions visible in the highlights panel component.\nAdd a Path component to your lead and opportunity pages.\nChange the default tab for your record’s home page.\nAdd the Related List Quick Links component or a Related List - Single component.\nCompact layouts drive the fields that users see in the highlights panel. Create a custom compact layout for an object to reflect the fields that your users most need to see in the highlights panel.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
