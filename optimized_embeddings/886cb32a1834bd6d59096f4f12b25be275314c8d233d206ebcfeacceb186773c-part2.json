A redirect URL must begin with https:// and contain fewer than 2,000 characters.\n\nTo edit a URL redirect, deactivate the URL alias.\nOpen the landing page content detail page and then click URL.\nClick .\nEnter a valid URL redirect.\nSave your work.\nSEE ALSO\nCreate a Landing Page in Marketing Cloud Growth\nSEO Page Properties for Landing Pages in Marketing Cloud Growth\nAdd Site Contributors to Marketing Cloud Growth\nManage Trusted URLs\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
