Busy people aren't always eager for change, so keep an eye on adoption rates and encourage users to stay in the new interface. This is also the time to iterate on your rollout plan by moving over more users, adding new features and use cases, and looking for ways to improve your implementation. And when the day comes to turn off access to Salesforce Classic, you can call your transition a success!\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nMeasure the Success of Your Lightning Experience Transition\nAfter you roll out Lightning Experience to users, monitor that you're hitting your goals, improving business, and getting traction with users. Collect user feedback to see what’s working and what’s not. The Lightning Experience Transition Change Management Hub has options for doing surveys. And track adoption metrics, like daily active users and number of users switching to Salesforce Classic, with the Lightning Usage App.\nMotivate Users to Work in Lightning Experience\nBecause busy people don’t always have time for change, you may need to encourage your users to make the switch to Lightning Experience. Automate some of this effort with out-of-the-box onboarding and assistance options that show the productivity benefits from working in the new interface.\nIterate on Your Lightning Experience Rollout Plan\nAfter rolling out Lightning Experience to a group of users and getting insights from feedback and success metrics, iterate for the next group. Update the rollout plan to reflect lessons learned. Give the next group a better experience by addressing the critical issues that are affecting current Lightning Experience users. And check for new features and innovations to see if there are other use cases to consider for the plan. We also recommend running Salesforce Optimizer to find opportunities for improving your org. Even if you aren’t doing a phased rollout, this is a good time to look for ways to clean up and enhance your implementation.\nTurn Off Salesforce Classic for Your Org\nWhen all your users are working in Lightning Experience and everyone has the features and functionality they need, proclaim your Lightning Experience transition a success. Mark the occasion—and stop supporting two interfaces—by turning off your org’s access to Salesforce Classic.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
