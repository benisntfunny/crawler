To delete a library that contains content, move the content to another library or delete it and then permanently delete it from your Recycle Bin.\nNOTE If your Recycle Bin is empty and you are unable to delete the library, another user's Recycle Bin can contain deleted content from the same library. A library cannot be deleted until all its content is permanently deleted or moved to another library.\nEdit Members to add or remove library members or change their library permission.\nTagging Rules to change the tagging method permitted in the library.\nRecord Types to restrict the record types available to library contributors.\nView Archived Content to view a list of archived content in the library. If you don’t have the Archive Content or Manage Libraries privilege in your library permission, the archived content list only contains content that you authored and archived, not content that other authors archived.\n\nThe library detail page contains these sections.\n\nMembers\n\nThis section lists all the Salesforce CRM Content users who are members of the library. To limit the member list, enter a username and click Filter. You can filter by the beginning of a username but not the last name.\n\nTo add new members to the library:\n\nClick Add Members.\nIf the member you want to add isn’t listed, type their first name in the search box and click Find.\nSelect members from the Available Members box. Members can include individual Salesforce CRM Content users or public groups containing Salesforce CRM Content users.\nTIP If you have many Salesforce CRM Content users, create a public group and add it to a library rather than adding users to the library individually.\nTo add the members to the library, click Add.\nClick Next.\nWARNING When you add a guest user as a member of the library, the library and files become publicly accessible.\nSelect a library permission for each user or public group and click Save.\n\nTo remove a member from the library, click Remove. To change a member's library permission, click Edit and choose a new library permission from the dropdown list.\n\nFeatured Content\n\nThis section lists the five pieces of content in the library most recently designated as “featured.” If no content has been featured, this section does not display. Featured content receives a higher priority than similar content in search results; for example, if 100 files contain the search criteria term sales asset, any featured files with that term appear at the top of the search results list. To see all featured content, click Show All. To toggle the feature status on or off, go to its content details page.\n\nTop Content\n\nThis section includes lists that summarize content activity in your library. Within a list, click a file icon to download the content or click the title to open the associated content details page. In the Top Content section you can choose from the following categories:\n\nPublication Date—This content is sorted in descending order according to the most recent publication date. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the published files, Web links, and Google docs.\nNum Downloads—This content is sorted in descending order according to the highest number of downloads. The bar graphic indicates how one record compares to another. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the downloaded content.\nRating—This content is sorted in descending order according to the highest number of thumbs-up votes. Green and red in the bar graphic represent positive and negative votes, respectively. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the content with votes.\nNum Comments—This content is sorted in descending order according to the highest number of viewer comments. The bar graphic indicates how one record compares to another. Choose the number of records you want to view from the accompanying dropdown list, or click the Show All button to list all the content with associated comments.\nPopular Tags\n\nThis “tag cloud” shows you how the content in your library has been labeled. Tags are descriptive terms assigned during upload or revision that help classify and organize content. Click a tag name to view search results containing all the files, Web links, and Google docs with that tag. The tag names increase in size within the tag cloud according to popularity, meaning that the largest tags have been assigned to the most content. You can choose to sort the tags alphabetically or by popularity. The tag cloud contains the 30 most popular tags.\n\nRecent Activity\n\nThis section is a snapshot of activity within your library. It shows the most recent files, Web links, and Google docs to receive comments, votes, or subscriptions. Featured content and newly published content are also included, but new versions of existing content, archived content, and deleted content do not appear in the Recent Activity section. Use the Older and Newer buttons to scroll through records. The Recent Activity section contains a maximum of 100 records.\n\nMost Active Contributors\n\nThis section shows the authors who have uploaded content into your library most frequently. The names increase in size according to activity, so the largest names are the authors who have contributed the most content.\n\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
