Service agents can resolve queries related to transactions, charges and fees, balances and statements, and title transfers. Agents can use the action launcher to quickly reverse a fee or change the address related to a financial account. They can track key record alerts and milestones, assign interest tags, visualize relationships on interactive graphs, and upsell financial products and services.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\nHow Captive Finance Records Work Together in Automotive Cloud\nLearn how different financial records work together in Automotive Cloud. You can model information related to loans and leases, assets, vehicles, titles, and financial account participants using the Finance Console for Automotive App.\nCreate Financial Accounts in Automotive Cloud\nUse Financial Account records to track the automotive loans and leases related to your captive finance customers. Track the down payment amount, principal amount, and interest rate for each loan or lease. Easily identify the past due amount and outstanding payment amount so that you can engage your customers with timely alerts. In Automotive Cloud, you can create financial accounts for loans and leases that finance vehicles and other types of assets.\nAdd Participants to Financial Accounts in Automotive Cloud\nA financial account can have multiple stakeholders related to it such as the owner of the vehicle financed through a loan, the guarantor of the loan, and the driver. You can track all accounts and contacts related to a vehicle loan or lease by using Financial Account Party records. Moreover, a single account can play multiple roles for a loan or lease. For example, a household member can be the driver and the leasee.\nTrack Payments and Transactions for Financial Accounts in Automotive Cloud\nView details of each transaction made against a loan or lease, and the summarized billing statements for a financial account in the Finance Console for Automotive app. You can track the credit and debit transactions along with details such as transaction status, status, and amount. You can also track the billing statements and the balance summary on a specific date for a financial account.\nTrack Fees and Charges for Financial Accounts in Automotive Cloud\nTrack the fees and charges levied on a loan or lease account, such as maintenance charges, end-of-lease fees, and excess mileage charges. The Fees tab on a Financial Account record page in the Finance Console for Automotive app shows all fees related to a loan or a lease.\nTrack Vehicles Related to Financial Accounts in Automotive Cloud\nA customer can have multiple vehicles financed through different loans and leases. Captive finance sales managers can track all vehicles and other assets related to each financial account for a customer’s account. Use Party Financial Asset to list all vehicles financed by a customer, and use Financial Account Party Financial Asset to relate the vehicle to the relevant financing option. You can also use Party Financial Asset Additional Owner records to track shared ownership of financed vehicles.\nManage Vehicle Titles and Related Participants in Automotive Cloud\nCreate titles to establish the legal ownership of vehicles and other assets such as electric vehicle charging stations or shipping containers. A title is unique to a single vehicle record but can be related to multiple accounts, contacts, or users based on the role of the participant. For example, an account can be the owner while another account can be the lienholder for a vehicle title. Multiple vehicles and their related titles can be related to a financial account, such as a loan or a lease.\nCustomer and Financial Account Consoles in Automotive Cloud\nThe Account page in the Finance Console for Automotive app gives you visibility into a business or an individual’s related cases, opportunities, and contacts. You can also see the automotive loans and leases where the account is a participant, such as a co-owner, a beneficiary, or a nominee. The Financial Account page in the app helps you drill down into each loan or lease account. View transactions, statements, and vehicle titles related to the loan or lease. Components such as record alerts, milestones, timelines, and actionable relationship center graphs help you deliver proactive service and engage with your captive finance customers.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
