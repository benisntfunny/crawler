Learn how the report assesses the readiness of your org’s user profiles, and which features and customizations are evaluated. You can use these details to develop your rollout plan and prioritize what to focus on.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nThe Readiness Check and the Readiness Report are available in English only.\nNOTE The Readiness Check only has access to the metadata in your implementation. The tool evaluates supporting data only and not the data within your records or other content you add to Salesforce.\nPredict Your Rollout Benefits and Effort\n\nNeed help influencing stakeholders and executives to support the move to Lightning Experience? For some Salesforce admins with Sales Cloud licenses, the Readiness Check can make educated guesses about:\n\nThe benefits and productivity improvements from moving to Lightning Experience\nThe time it might take to roll out Lightning Experience\n\nIf you don’t see these predictions in your report, sign up for a free small-group session with a Lightning expert to get more information. You get an invitation to register after you run the Readiness Check.\n\nSee Which Users Are Ready for Lightning Experience\n\nBased on the features and customizations that the Readiness Check evaluates, your Readiness Report gives you an analysis of where each user profile stands. The analysis is based on the number of features for each profile that require attention, as well as the impact that particular feature gaps have on users with the profile.\n\nThe Readiness Report shows which profiles will be productive in Lightning Experience without any work. For profiles that aren’t ready yet because they depend on functionality that needs attention, the report identifies the relevant features.\n\nEvaluate Your Features and Customizations\n\nHere’s what the Readiness Check evaluates for you.\n\nTIP We frequently add new features to the Readiness Check. Check the Release Notes for updates to this list.\nUser profiles\nTabs and objects:\nDocuments\nTerritory Management\nEnterprise Territory Management\nSales Cloud related lists:\nAccount Contact Roles\nAccount Partners\nCampaign Influence\nOpportunity Partners\nHome page and sidebar components\nEmail templates\nMail merge\nLookup fields\nActivities\nCases\nReport and dashboard folder sharing\nReport Builder\nThird-party computer-telephony integration (CTI)\nSalesforce Console (Sales and Service)\nOmni-Channel\nChat\nSalesforce Knowledge\nSOS\nEntitlements\nSolutions\nS-controls\nSharing buttons\nWeb browsers\nNOTE To evaluate actions and buttons, JavaScript buttons and link, Visualforce pages, AppExchange packages, or Hard-coded URLs, try the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter.\n\nThe Readiness Check requires metadata to evaluate features. Therefore, the report sometimes only evaluates a feature for a specific area. For example, it covers Sales Cloud related lists, but not all lists in general. It covers email templates but not mass email. There are some features that the tool doesn’t evaluate at all, including customizable navigation, Ideas, macros, custom keyboard shortcuts, Recycle Bin, reports, and dashboards. We recommend that you manually evaluate the features and customizations that aren’t covered by the Readiness Check.\n\nSEE ALSO\nHow Does the Lightning Experience Readiness Check Count User Impact?\nPreview Your Org in Lightning Experience\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
