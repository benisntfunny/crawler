Automotive Cloud makes it easy for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and dealer groups to represent all types of stakeholders and account structures. Capture information about business profiles, households, and organization structures of your dealer groups, customers, and suppliers. Associate multiple participants such as owners, drivers, dealers, and financiers with an asset, such as a car, an accessory, or a spare part. And with components such as relationship cards and relationship graphs, get quick access to all stakeholder details.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions.\nHow Groups of People Are Represented in Automotive Cloud\nThere are multiple stakeholders involved in the lifecycle of vehicles, such as the manufacturer, dealers, finance relationship managers and consultants, primary and secondary borrowers, and customers. Capture key information about different types of people in your automotive ecosystem.\nGroups and Households in Automotive Cloud\nGet a holistic view of your customers and the different groups and households they’re related to. As an automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or dealer, you can use the information in groups and households to present personalized offers, messaging, and customer journeys. Dealers can improve lead conversion rates if they have information about the multiple households and groups that a prospect belongs to. For OEMs, it’s important to know how different relationships work between two accounts, two contacts, or between contacts related to multiple accounts. With Automotive Cloud, you can visualize complex relationships between multiple parties and tailor subscriptions, warranty terms, and services based on this information.\nCreate Internal Organizational Units in Automotive Cloud\nIn Automotive Cloud, stakeholder groups are modeled as accounts. To simplify reporting and target-setting, create internal organizational units that identify your departments or account structures. For example, you can create an internal organizational unit for all sales dealer accounts, and each dealership account can be related to the unit.\nCreate Business Profiles in Automotive Cloud\nIn Automotive Cloud, you can model all stakeholders for an automotive company as Account records. To capture additional information about each stakeholder account, primarily dealers, create Business Profile records. Each dealer can have a Business Profile record where you can add details, such as the type of services provided by the dealer, and the registered name and code of the account.\nCreate Suppliers in Automotive Cloud\nCapture key information about vendor and supplier accounts that supply raw materials or product components to your company. You can also capture information about third-party vendors that provide utilities and services, such as electricity, heating and ventilation, and transportation.\nCreate Asset Account Participants in Automotive Cloud\nUse Asset Account Participant records to relate every asset in your org—a vehicle, a part, or an accessory—to relevant Account records. You can relate multiple stakeholders to an asset during the asset's lifecycle. For example, a car can be related to the dealers who sell the car, the service dealers who repair and maintain the car, and the customer who purchases the car. If the car is used or refurbished, you can also track the financiers and the consultants who help with trade-in transactions.\nCreate Asset Contact Participants in Automotive Cloud\nUse Asset Contact Participant records to relate every asset in your org—a vehicle, a part, or an accessory—to relevant Contact records. You can relate an asset to multiple stakeholders and track the contacts related to each asset. For example, you can track the sales relation manager of the dealership branch where the asset is stocked. You can also track the support manager or the driver of a vehicle. One asset can have multiple contact participants.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
