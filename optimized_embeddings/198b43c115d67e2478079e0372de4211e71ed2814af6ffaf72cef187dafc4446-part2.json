We recommend that you avoid collecting information that you don’t need and any sensitive information that could be used for discrimination or other unlawful uses. For more information, see our Acceptable Use and External-Facing Services Policy.\n\nTo edit the picklist values on the Occupation and Area of Interest fields, include the new value as a custom label and refer to it in the Visualforce page. These are the values in the form by default:\n\nOccupation\nChemical & Hazardous Materials\nCommunications & IT\nCritical Manufacturing\nDefense\nEducation & Child Care\nEmergency Services\nEnergy\nFinancial Services\nFood & Agriculture\nGovernment/Community Based Essential Functions\nHealthcare Worker\nIndustrial, commercial, residential sheltering facilities and services\nRetired\nTransportation & Logistics\nUnemployed\nWater & Wastewater\nOther\nArea of Interest\nCovid-19 Care\nNew Patient Inquiry\nFind a Doctor\nRefer a Patient\nOther\nPrivacy and Legal Requirement Attestations\n\nThe checkboxes in the sign-up form contain attestations that fulfill legal requirements around obtaining consent for collecting recipients’ information, receiving consent to contact them, and having recipients acknowledge they have received relevant information about the COVID vaccines and their risks and benefits.\n\nIMPORTANT The provided text is intended as a sample only and should not be used in place of your own legal requirement attestation text for these checkboxes. Please consult with your organization’s own legal counsel to include appropriate language for your own particular use cases and to ensure compliance with local privacy and healthcare laws, as well as any other applicable laws or guidance.\n\nYou must:\n\nEdit Vaccination Sign-Up Form to replace the checkbox text with your own policies and legal requirements.\nReplace the placeholder text with your organization’s own legal requirements attestation language, as provided by your organization’s legal counsel. This can include a brief privacy statement and acknowledgement with a link to your company’s main privacy notice or statement.\nConfirm that you’re complying with all applicable laws and regulations before sending your sign-up form to recipients.\nImages\n\nTo use your own images in the sign-up flow, upload them as static resources and save the static resource names. Then, edit each Visualforce page in the vaccination eligibility sign-up flow and replace the image references from the placeholder images to your images.\n\nWe recommend that any people in your images are shown wearing protective face masks.\n\nRedirect Button\n\nThe confirmation step in the sign-up flow contains two placeholder buttons: View FAQs and New Sign-Up. The View FAQs button contains a redirect link.\n\nEdit the Vaccination Sign-Up Success Page and replace the View FAQs button text and link to reflect the page or resource where you want to redirect recipients after they’ve completed the form.\n\nIMPORTANT If the Default Web Address is populated in the Force.com site for the four Visualforce pages, update the page references. For example, your page reference might change from .../apex/vaxpk__PreRegEntry to .../YOURWEBADDRESS/apex/vaxpk__PreRegEntry.\nSEE ALSO\nView and Edit Visualforce Pages\nDefine Static Resources\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
