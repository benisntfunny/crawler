For example, complete one import for people who opted into your weekly email newsletter subscription and another import for people who opted out of that subscription.\nEach import file must include a contact point value and the date of consent. A contact point value is either an email address or a phone number.\nConsent is tied to the contact point. A contact point is associated with a Unified Individual based on the identity resolution ruleset in your org.\nConsent imports update the status and date of consent for each contact point in the import file. To create or update leads or contacts, import from the Leads or Contacts tab.\nFormatting the Date of Consent\n\nWhen you import consent data, the system maps the data in your import file to the correct DMOs and converts timestamps based on time zone. To ensure that the system maps the date that you captured consent correctly, you must format each date entry as one of these supported DateTime datatypes.\n\nyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSZ\nMM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss\nMM/DD/YYYY\nyyyy-MM-dd\nM/DD/YYYY\n\nThis table breaks down the format for DateTime datatypes.\n\nLETTER CODE\tDATE OR TIME COMPONENT\tEXAMPLE\nyyyy-MM-dd\tDate in year-month-day format\t2023-05-01\nHH:mm:ss:SSS\tTimestamp in hour-minute-second-millisecond and format based on a 24-hour clock\t14:30:00:000\nZ\tRepresents UTC offset timezone where Z defaults to -800\tZ OR -800\nEmail File Guidelines\n\nWhen formatting a CSV to import email consent data, keep these guidelines in mind.\n\nThe file must include a column for email addresses and a separate column for recording the date of consent.\nEach email must be a valid and complete email address. For example,\nlyn@ursasolar.com\n.\nEmails can’t include special characters.\nSMS File Guidelines\n\nWhen formatting a CSV to import consent data for SMS messages, keep these guidelines in mind.\n\nThe file must include a column for phone numbers and a separate column for recording the date of consent.\nFor each entry, you must include a country code and the complete phone number. Phone numbers are validated based on ITU E.164 standards. For example, a United States phone number with the country code looks like this:\n+1-555-555-5555\nSpaces, dashes, underscores, and parentheses are automatically removed from phone numbers.\nPhone numbers can’t include letters or special characters.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
