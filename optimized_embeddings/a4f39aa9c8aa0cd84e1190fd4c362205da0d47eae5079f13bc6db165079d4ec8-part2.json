Support staff can pop out the utility, arrange it onscreen wherever they like, and then pop it back into the utility bar or close the window when they're done.\nExpand the Appointment Manager\nWorking in the Appointment Manager can feel cramped, especially when managing appointments with multiple attendees. To give support staff a better experience viewing and editing appointment and attendee details, you can make the Appointment Manager bigger.\nHide the Note Actions in the Appointment Manager\nIf you're using a custom object to manage support notes instead of using Salesforce Notes, then your support staff aren't using the Appointment Manager Action menus to add Notes. To prevent confusion, hide the Note Action menu options in the Appointment Manager.\nAllow the Appointment Manager to Pop Out\n\nYou can enable the Appointment Manager to pop out of the utility bar into its own window. Support staff can pop out the utility, arrange it onscreen wherever they like, and then pop it back into the utility bar or close the window when they're done.\n\nBecause the Appointment Manager is a custom utility, the pop-out option is available only if you activate the critical update, Utility Bar: Enable Pop-Out for Custom Utilities. Review the critical update and see Using Pop-Out Utilities in Salesforce Help for setup details.\n\nExpand the Appointment Manager\n\nWorking in the Appointment Manager can feel cramped, especially when managing appointments with multiple attendees. To give support staff a better experience viewing and editing appointment and attendee details, you can make the Appointment Manager bigger.\n\nFrom Setup, search for and then select App Manager.\nClick the action menu for Student Success Hub and select Edit.\n\nSelect Utility Items (Desktop Only) from the App Settings menu.\n\nBy default, the Appointment Manager is 720 by 480 pixels. Try starting with an increase of 50 percent (width) and 25 percent (height).\n\nIn the Appointment Manager properties, change Panel Width to 1080 and Panel Height to 600.\n\nSave your changes.\nBack in the Student Success Hub app, see how the Appointment Details and Attendee Snapshot panels look in the Appointment Manager (you may have to refresh the page and reopen the Appointment Manager). Adjust the utility's size as needed.\nHide the Note Actions in the Appointment Manager\n\nIf you're using a custom object to manage support notes instead of using Salesforce Notes, then your support staff aren't using the Appointment Manager Action menus to add Notes. To prevent confusion, hide the Note Action menu options in the Appointment Manager.\n\nFrom Setup, search for and then select Custom Settings.\nNext to SSH Hierarchy Settings, click Manage.\nClick Edit, then select Disable Enhanced Notes.\nSave your changes.\nVerify in the Appointment Manager that the Add Note action no longer appears in the Action menu for an attendee. Also verify that Add Note for All Attendees no longer appears in the Action menu for the appointment.\nNOTE If you disable the actions that create Salesforce Notes in the Appointment Manager, then you likely don't want to allow access to these Notes anywhere in the Student Success Hub app, including the Notes related list on the Student Record Case, the Notes tool in the utility bar, and the Notes item in the app navigation menu.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
