As an automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or dealer, you can use the information in groups and households to present personalized offers, messaging, and customer journeys. Dealers can improve lead conversion rates if they have information about the multiple households and groups that a prospect belongs to. For OEMs, it’s important to know how different relationships work between two accounts, two contacts, or between contacts related to multiple accounts. With Automotive Cloud, you can visualize complex relationships between multiple parties and tailor subscriptions, warranty terms, and services based on this information.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nHow Groups and Households Are Modeled in Automotive Cloud\nTo show how different relationship groups are represented in Automotive Cloud, we’ll use the example of Neo Motors, an automotive original equipment manufacturer (OEM).\nCreate Account Contact Relationships in Automotive Cloud\nDefine relationships of people with multiple households or groups by using Account Contact Relationship records. An automotive manufacturer or dealer must track how the contact is related to each account. For example, a person belongs to two separate household business accounts because their parents are separated. Or, a financial consultant is a primary contact at a captive finance account where he’s an employee, and also a related contact for a household account who uses the services of the consultant. Create account contact relationships to relate a contact with multiple accounts.\nCreate Account Account Relationships in Automotive Cloud\nDefine a relationship between two business accounts by using Account Account Relationship records. An automotive manufacturer or dealer must track the relationship between different types of accounts. For example, two households can be related if members of these households are in a marital relationship. Or, a bank can be related to a customer because the customer has taken a car loan from that bank. A service dealer account can be related to a housing community account, which in turn has multiple individual household accounts. Create account account relationships to relate parent and child accounts or peer accounts.\nCreate Contact Contact Relationships in Automotive Cloud\nDefine a relationship between two contacts or two person accounts by using Contact Contact Relationship records. For example, multiple members of the same family can own vehicles. Or, a dealer representative at a spare parts service dealership can be the preferred rep for multiple person accounts who are customers. Create contact contact relationships to relate parent and child records or peer records.\nCreate Party Role Relationships in Automotive Cloud\nDefine the role of members in a household, a group, or between two participants who are related to each other by using Party Role Relationship records.. An automotive manufacturer or dealer must track different types of relationships that are important to their customers. Some relationships are reciprocal, such as parent-child relationships in a household, or the service provider and service benefactor relationship between a repair shop and the vehicle owner. Other relationships can be linear, such as the relationship between two person accounts who are members of the same co-operative living society and are neighbors.\nCreate Party Relationship Groups in Automotive Cloud\nCreate a party relationship group to represent a group of people living together, such as a household, a co-operative, a group of spare parts dealers, or a group of vehicle accessory wholesalers. When you define a customer as a business account in Automotive Cloud, create a related Party Relationship Group record to store information about the household of the customer. Or, create a party relationship group to represent dealer groups and relate them to a dealer account. Use party relationship groups to track the lifetime value of vehicles, parts, and services that a group purchased.\nMerge and Split Groups or Households in Automotive Cloud\nMerge two party relationship groups so that members, related contacts, groups, and businesses from a secondary group are added to the primary group. For example, merge two dealer groups after an acquisition. Use the Split guided workflow to move members, related contacts, groups, and business accounts from a party relationship group to a new or an existing party relationship group. For example, split two households after a divorce ora separation.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
