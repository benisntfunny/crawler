We also recommend using project deploy start to deploy source. For more information, see the Salesforce CLI Command reference for the project commands.\n\nHere’s an example of the steps for changing the Health Verification Form LWC.\n\nIn an existing Salesforce DX project, retrieve all the metadata from the Safety Cloud Template package by running this command in the terminal.\nsf project retrieve start --package-name \"Safety Cloud Template\" --target-org <username in org being deployed to>\n\nChange the LWC components to suit your needs.\nDeploy your changes by running this command in the terminal.\nsf project deploy start --source-dir \"Safety Cloud Template/main/default/lwc\" --target-org <same username as step 1>\n\nModify the Consent Acknowledgment Page\n\nThe consent acknowledgment page contains attestations that are necessary to comply with legal requirements for obtaining recipients’ information about their COVID-19 status.\n\nIMPORTANT Consult with your organization’s own legal counsel to include appropriate language for your own particular use cases. Also, consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance with local privacy and healthcare laws, and any other applicable laws or guidance.\nModify the Health Verification Request Form\n\nEvery event that requires Health Verification is represented through the system as an Occasion.\n\nAn Occasion can have multiple events at multiple locations over multiple days. For each of those event instances, there must be a unique health verification with its own Occasion Setting record.\n\nIn each Occasion Setting record, you configure details like the name and graphic on the Health Verification form and which verification methods are acceptable for the event. Safety Cloud comes with Occasion Rules and Regulations that stipulate which vaccine brands or test providers are acceptable for Health Verification for you to configure.\n\nNOTE You can also configure your own Occasion Rules & Regulations based on event-specific requirements.\n\nFor every Health Verification form submitted, Safety Cloud creates a Health Verification record of a particular verification type (test, vaccination) and status (needs review, verified). These Health Verification records dictate the automation of the system.\n\nThe form contains the Health Verification Method picklist, date picker, Vaccine Brand Name picklist, and file upload component.\n\nUsers who select Documentation of COVID-19 with recovery as the verification method can be required to upload more than one type of verification data, per government health agency guidelines. For example, in the U.S., if a person selects Documentation of COVID-19 with Recovery, the CDC requires two types of verification data. The person must provide a positive COVID-19 test result within 90 days of the event date. The person must also provide a signed letter on official letterhead from the user’s healthcare provider. Or they can have a public health official state that they meet the criteria to end isolation.\n\nWe recommend creating an Apex job to automatically delete the Health Verification file attachments or Health Card records and related health information for users who select the Health Card QR Code Verification Method. By default, the related attachments on Health Verification records are deleted 24 hours after the date in the Event Date field. You can change the scheduled job based on your data retention and file deletion policies, but consult with your organization’s legal counsel before doing so. Consulting with legal council helps ensure that you adhere to local privacy laws and regulations. To learn more, see Automatically Delete Health Verification Attachments and Health Card Records with an Apex Job .\n\nModify the Status Pages\nThree status pages, In Review, Accepted, and Rejected, show customers their request status and how to contact you for more information. Edit the provided text, and make sure to replace the placeholders, like the phone number.\nAdd Content to the FAQ Page and Terms & Conditions Page\nEdit the text in the placeholder pages for FAQs and your Terms & Conditions and Privacy Notice with your own content.\n\nIn the faq.js file, there’s an example that shows how to format different FAQs based on the OccasionId.\n\nEach FAQ can be shared across multiple Occasions. For example:\n\n\noptions = [\n        {\n            id: 1,\n            occasionIds: ['a0GB000001bfot6MAA'],\n            question: 'Sample Question Label 1',\n            answer: 'Sample Answer Label 1'\n        },\n        {\n            id: 2,\n            occasionIds: ['a0GB000001a7BbfMAE'],\n            question: 'Sample Question Label 2',\n            answer: 'Sample Answer Label 2'\n        }\n    ];\n\n\nIn the termsAndConditions.js file, there’s an example that shows how to format different Terms & Conditions based on the OccasionId.\n\nEach Occasion has only one label for Terms & Conditions. For example:\n\n\noptions = {\n        'a0GB000001a7BbfMAE': termsAndConditionsBodySample,\n        'a0GB000001bfot6MAN': 'Sample'\n    };\n\nSEE ALSO\nCreate an Occasion\nCreate an Occasion Setting\nAdd a Logo for an Occasion Setting\nCreate Occasion Rules and Regulations for an Occasion Setting\nsfdx\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
