Hyperparameters sit outside the generated model.\nInference\tThe process of requesting a model to generate content.\nInference pipelines\tA sequence of reusable generative steps stitched together to accomplish a generation task. This includes resolving prompt instructions, passing it to an LLM, moderating the results, and sending results back to the user.\nIntent\tAn end user’s goal for interacting with an AI assistant.\nLarge language model (LLM)\tA language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters trained on large quantities of text.\nMachine learning\tA subfield of AI specializing in computer systems that are designed to learn, adapt, and improve based on feedback and inferences from data, rather than explicit instruction.\nModel cards\tDocuments details about the model’s performance as well as inputs, outputs, training method, conditions under which the model works best, and ethical considerations in use.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP)\tA branch of AI that uses machine learning to understand language as written by people. Large language models are one of many approaches to NLP.\nParameter size\tThe number of parameters the model uses to process and generate data.\nPrompt\tA natural language description of the task to be accomplished. An input to the LLM.\nPrompt chaining\tThe method of breaking up complex tasks into several intermediate steps and then tying it back together so that the AI generates a more concrete, customized, and better result.\nPrompt design\tPrompt design is the process of creating prompts that improve the quality and accuracy of the model’s responses. Many models expect a certain prompt structure, so it’s important to test and iterate them on the model you’re using. After you understand what structure works best for a model, you can optimize your prompts for the given use case.\nPrompt engineering\tAn emerging discipline within AI focused on maximizing the performance and reliability of models by crafting prompts in a systematic and scientifically rigorous way.\nPrompt injection\tA method used to control or manipulate the model's output by giving it certain prompts. With this method, users and third parties attempt to get around restrictions and perform tasks that the model wasn't designed for.\nPrompt instructions\tPrompt instructions are natural language instructions entered into a prompt template. Your user just has to send an instruction to Einstein. Instructions have a verb-noun structure and a task for the LLM, such as “Write a description no longer than 500 characters.” Your user’s instructions are added to the app’s prompt template, and then relevant CRM data replaces the template’s placeholders. The prompt template is now a grounded prompt and is sent to the LLM.\nPrompt management\tThe suite of tools used to effectively build, manage, package, and share prompts.\nPrompt template\tA string with placeholders that are replaced with business data values to generate a final text instruction that is sent to the LLM.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\tA form of grounding that uses an information retrieval system like a knowledge base to enrich a prompt with relevant context, for inference or training.\nSemantic retrieval\tA scenario that allows an LLM to use similar and relevant historical business data that exists in a customer's CRM data.\nSystem cards\tAn expansion of the concepts within, and application of, model cards to address the complexity of an overall AI system, which may integrate multiple models. For LLM-based systems this includes the core components of model cards (for example, performance, use cases, ethical considerations) plus how the system operates, what models it uses, as well as how content is chosen, generated, and delivered.\nTemperature\tA parameter that controls how predictable and varied the model's outputs are. A model with a high temperature generates random and diverse responses. A model with a low temperature generates focused and more consistent responses.\nToxicity\tA term describing many types of discourse, including but not limited to offensive, unreasonable, disrespectful, unpleasant, harmful, abusive, or hateful language.\nTrusted AI\tGuidelines created by Salesforce that are focused on the responsible development and implementation of AI.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
