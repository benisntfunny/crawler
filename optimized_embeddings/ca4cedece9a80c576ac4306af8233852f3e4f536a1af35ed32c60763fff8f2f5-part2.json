The filter is also deleted from the corresponding category picklist in Trailmaker Content. If you provided translations for the filter in other languages, those translations are also deleted.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS AND USER PERMISSIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\n\n\nUSER ROLES\nThis topic supports these enablement site roles:\t\nSalesforce Admins\nContent Creators\nRelease Managers\n\nThe steps that you take to delete a filter from your enablement site depend on whether the filter is associated with content.\n\nFILTER IS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTENT?\tSTEPS TO DELETE\nNo\tDelete the filter in Trailmaker Settings.\nYes, but the content isn’t published\t\nDelete the unpublished release.\nDelete the filter in Trailmaker Settings.\n\nYes, and the content is published.\t\nRemove the filter from the content in Trailmaker Content.\nPreview the release, and confirm that the filter is no longer visible.\nPublish the revised content, with the filter removed, using Trailmaker Release.\nDelete the filter in Trailmaker Settings.\nNOTE You can’t delete the last filter in a category. Each category must have at least one filter.\n\nAfter you delete a filter:\n\nTrailmaker Content users can’t assign the filter to modules or trails.\nLearners can’t sort published content or search results using the filter.\nTrail Tracker users can’t run reports based on the filter.\n\nA filter that’s visible in Trailmaker but isn’t associated with a published module or trail isn’t visible to your enablement site users. A filter that’s associated only with content in an unpublished release also isn’t visible to your enablement site users. A filter is visible to your users only when it’s associated with at least one published module or trail.\n\nDelete a Filter from Trailmaker Settings\nWhen a filter is listed on the Filters page in Trailmaker Settings but isn’t associated with content, you can delete it from Trailmaker Settings. When you remove the filter, you also delete all its translations, and the filter is deleted from the corresponding category list in Trailmaker Content. A filter that’s listed in Trailmaker but isn’t associated with published content isn’t visible to your enablement site users.\nDelete a Filter That’s Associated with Content in an Unpublished Release\nIf you have an unpublished release with content that still uses a filter that you want to delete, Trailmaker prevents you from deleting the filter from Trailmaker Settings. After you delete all unpublished releases from all content collections, you can then delete the filter. Coordinating this action can require collaborating with admins, writers, release managers, and others.\nDelete a Filter That’s Associated with Published Content\nWhen a filter is associated with published content, you must delete the filter from the published content before you can delete it from Trailmaker. In this case, deleting the filter requires changes in Trailmaker Content, Trailmaker Release, and Trailmaker Settings. Coordinating this change can require collaboration among admins, writers, release managers, and others.\nSEE ALSO\nAdd a Custom Filter for Enablement Site Content\nFind Content on an Enablement Site\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
