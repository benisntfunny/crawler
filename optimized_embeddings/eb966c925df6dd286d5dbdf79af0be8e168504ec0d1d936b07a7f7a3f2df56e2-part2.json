These objects also track progress that users make through a program and its items.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Lightning Experience\nFull Enablement is available with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nEnablement Lite is available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions\nPartner Enablement is available with Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, or Salesforce Platform for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions. A supported PRM add-on license is required.\nDesign Time\n\nSome records are added when you create a program, create a measure, or add an exercise that references content in the Enablement workspace in the Digital Experiences app.\n\nOBJECT\tDESCRIPTION\nEnablement Program\tSpecifies a program’s title, description, duration, and publication status. This object also specifies the number of enrolled users, the number of users who completed the program, and the number of users who are behind.\nEnablement Program Section\tSpecifies the title of a section in a program and the position of the section relative to other sections.\nEnablement Program Task Definition\tSpecifies the title, description, and day in the program for an outcome, milestone, or exercise. For an exercise, this object also specifies the relationship with content from the Enablement workspace in the Digital Experiences app.\nLearning Item\t\n\nRepresents an item that requires users to take action. A Learning Item record is created for the program and for each exercise with content or a link that a user clicks. Other related objects, such as Learning Content, Learning Lesson, Learning Link, and Learning Practice, define the content for different exercise types.\n\nA Learning Item record isn’t created for an exercise if another program already has an exercise with that same content.\n\n\nEnablement Measure Definition\tSpecifies the source object and optional related objects that a measure references. The measure definition also specifies optional field filters, filter logic, the calculation method, and the activation status.\nEnablement Program Task Measure\tAssociates a measure with an outcome or milestone. The outcome and each milestone can reference up to two measures.\nRun Time\n\nSome records are created when a user starts taking a published program. These records represent the relationship between a user and the program or the program items.\n\nOBJECT\tDESCRIPTION\nLearning Item Assignment\tSpecifies enrollment details for a user in a program, such as start date, due date, and whether the user is overdue. This record is created when a user enrolls in a program or when you assign a user to a program.\nLearning Item Progress\t\n\nSpecifies a user’s progress in the program, such as the number of days since the program started and the overall program completion status, or the user’s progress in a specific exercise.\n\nA Learning Item Progress record isn’t created for an exercise if the user has already progressed on the same content in another program.\n\n\nEnablement Program Task Progress\tSpecifies a user’s progress through an individual outcome, milestone, or exercise in a program.\nEnablement Program Task Measure Progress\tSpecifies a user’s progress through the requirements for an outcome or milestone.\nNOTE The Learning Item, Learning Item Assignment, and Learning Item Progress objects are also used with Learning Paths outside of Enablement.\nExample: Data Volume\n\nLet’s say that you create a simple program with these details.\n\nAn outcome that references Measure A\nSection 1\nMilestone 1 that references Measure B\nExercise 1 that references new Content A\nExercise 2 that references new Content B\nSection 2\nMilestone 1 that references Measure C\nExercise 3 that references new Content C\nExercise 4 that references existing Content D, which was used previously in another program\n\nIn this scenario, 20 records are created at design time.\n\nOBJECT\tNUMBER OF RECORDS CREATED\tEXPLANATION\nEnablement Program\t1\tOne for the program\nEnablement Program Section\t2\tOne for each section\nEnablement Program Task Definition\t7\t\nOne for the outcome\nOne for each milestone (two total)\nOne for each exercise (four total)\n\nLearning Item\t4\t\nOne for the program\nOne for each exercise that references new content (three total), but not one for the exercise that references content that was already used in another program\n\nEnablement Measure Definition\t3\t\nOne for the outcome’s measure\nOne for each milestone’s measure (two total)\n\nEnablement Program Task Measure\t3\t\nOne for the outcome\nOne for each milestone (two total)\n\nWhen a user takes the program, at least 15 more records are created at run time. Records for associated objects, such as LearningItemProgressShare, are also created at run time but not included in this example.\n\nOBJECT\tNUMBER OF RECORDS CREATED\tEXPLANATION\nLearning Item Assignment\t1\tOne for the user taking the program\nLearning Item Progress\t4\t\nOne for the program\nOne for each exercise that references new content (three total), but not one for the exercise that references content that was already used in another program\n\nEnablement Program Task Progress\t7\t\nOne for the outcome\nOne for each milestone (two total)\nOne for each exercise (four total)\n\nEnablement Program Task Measure Progress\t3\t\nOne for the outcome\nOne for each milestone (two total)\nSEE ALSO\nConsiderations for Analyzing Program Completion\nSalesforce Developers: EnablementMeasureDefinition\nSalesforce Developers: EnablementProgram\nSalesforce Developers: EnblProgramSection\nSalesforce Developers: EnblProgramTaskDefinition\nSalesforce Developers: EnblProgramTaskProgress\nSalesforce Developers: LearningItem\nSalesforce Developers: LearningItemAssignment\nSalesforce Developers: LearningItemProgress\nLearning Paths\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
