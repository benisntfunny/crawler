Some features are configured in Setup, others in the app, and some require integration with external systems. Make the most of features like Events and Milestones, Timeline, Actionable Relationship Center, Interest Tags, Relationship Cards, and Record Alerts to enhance your automotive business. Implement the features you need based on your business requirements.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nConfigure Events and Milestones for Automotive Cloud\nThe Events and Milestones component shows information about financial account milestones, asset milestones, life events, or business milestones for a Financial Account, Vehicle, Contact, or Account record respectively. Use the captured information to initiate follow-up actions, business processes, and reports.\nConfigure Timelines for Automotive Cloud\nTrack key events and activities related to a vehicle with the Timeline component on a Vehicle record page. A user can get information about upcoming, past, and current activities related to a vehicle from one timeline. Timeline eliminates the necessity of searching for information in multiple places by showing a vehicle’s entire activity history in one place. Customize the timeline as per your company’s requirements and ensure that each user finds the most relevant and useful information.\nConfigure Relationship Cards for Automotive Cloud\nUse Relationship Cards to show key information about stakeholders related to a vehicle’s lifecycle. After identifying the information that your users refer to, use the card setup flow to configure the relationship cards, and then add the cards to the desired page layouts.\nConfigure Actionable Relationship Center Graphs for Automotive Cloud\nHelp users understand the relationship between people and vehicles with Actionable Relationship Center (ARC) graphs. Build custom ARC graphs to connect objects that show related information such as households, visits and vehicles associated to an account. Add the ARC Relationship Graph component to Vehicle or Account pages to let your users engage with the records. Customize card names, display fields, and object and record actions so your users can easily navigate and interact with records during customer engagements.\nConfigure Record Alerts for Automotive Cloud\nHelp users take note of record changes with timely notifications. You can create record alerts manually in your org but it’s more likely that you create record alerts via integration techniques with external systems.\nConfigure Interest Tags for Automotive Cloud\nCapture your customer’s interests and preferences with interest tags. Ensure that everyone in your company uses a common interest tag dictionary and records are consistently tagged with terms from that global repository. Add the Interest Tags component to Lead, Opportunity, or Vehicle pages so that users working on these pages can easily add the relevant tags to a record during customer interactions.\nConfigure Intelligent Document Reader for Automotive Cloud\nConfigure Intelligent Document Reader that uses Amazon Textract for optical character recognition. You can upload documents in the JPG, JPEG, PNG, or PDF format and create document type templates that determine the type of information that’s extracted from a file and the objects where the extracted information is stored. For example, you can upload a prospect’s driver license, create a document type template for identity documents, and map the extracted information to Lead records. Or, create a document type template for invoices, upload a warranty claim invoice, and verify the extracted data against Warranty Term records in your org.\nImport Data From CSV Files in Automotive Cloud\nRapidly input large amounts of data into Automotive Cloud by preparing CSV files and importing them into Salesforce. Users can convert data from different sources or formats into a standardized structure which helps in data transformation and normalization. You can now import large amounts of data into standard and custom objects with minimal error and reduced time for data entry.\nConfigure Branch Management for Automotive Cloud\nTrack the performance and productivity of users in your company who operate out of different branches. For example, service agents or service technicians tied to specific customer locations, inventory managers or sales managers across various departments, and finance teams operating from specific branches. Model all users in your company as User records in your org, and set up multiple branches and associate users to the branch units. Add the Branch Selector utility app to the Automotive app so that users can select the branch they’re assigned to, and the leads and accounts they work with get automatically associated with their branch.\nConfigure Record Association Builder for Automotive Cloud\nDefine rules and criteria for automatically assigning records to branch units in your company. The Record Association Builder works with Branch Management seamlessly. You can define your own criteria for automatically linking records like accounts, leads, opportunities, and cases with the branches that work with them.\nConfigure Service Process Studio in Automotive Cloud\nUse Service Process Studio to create a process for your customer service operations. Customer service representative (CSRs) can launch a service process to work on customer service operations through their entire lifecycle, from request intake to fulfillment.\nSet Up Units of Measure for Automotive Cloud\nConfigure units of measure to specify the predefined unit for quantity, distance, or weight specifications.\nSet Up Geo Countries for Automotive Cloud\nCreate Geo Country and Geo State records to model the countries and states where vehicles are registered or sold. Vehicle definitions are associated with geocountries because the make and model specifications can vary by country. Asset titles are associated to geo states because a vehicle is officially registered in a state.\nDesign Actionable Member Segments in Automotive Cloud\nEmpower agents to proactively engage with prospective customers and dealer partners, and exceed your business goals. Curate a prioritized list of similar prospects to design personalized, timely engagement initiatives. Agents can seamlessly engage with prospects and customers with meaningful guidance.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
