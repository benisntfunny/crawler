You can configure and use them for your end-to-end rebate calculations and extend the templates as required. The flows trigger the data processing engine definitions to update the aggregate records, and also trigger calculation processes to update the final payout amounts. Admins can schedule the flows at regular intervals.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions that have Rebate Management enabled.\nIMPORTANT We recommend that you use the Rebate Orchestration Flow 2 template to orchestrate rebate payout calculations. This flow template is simpler, better performing, and more scalable than the Rebate Orchestration Flow template. You can clone and use the Rebate Orchestration Flow 2 template as is for end-to-end rebate calculations, or extend and customize it to suit your business needs. See Rebate Orchestration Flow 2.\nNOTE\n\nWe recommend that you save the flow templates and run your cloned flows instead of the predefined flows. As and when the flow templates are updated in later releases, you can choose to update your cloned flows without affecting any current rebate calculation runs.\n\nRebate Orchestration Flow\nRun the Rebate Orchestration Flow to calculate rebate amounts and process payouts. It includes other predefined Rebate flows as subflows. The flow searches for data processing engine definitions with Process Type as Rebates and triggers the aggregation of data. Then, the flow runs the calculation process to generate member payout amounts.\nRebate Orchestration Flow 2\nRebate Management includes a simpler and more scalable orchestration flow called Rebate Orchestration Flow 2. Just like the Rebate Orchestration Flow, this flow automates rebate records aggregation, calculation of rebate amounts, and payout processing. This flow includes a Calculate Rebate Payout for All Periods batch job that calculates the rebate payouts for aggregate records of all periods. The last execution date of the batch job is used to determine which aggregate records are used to calculate the rebate amounts and generate payouts. After payouts are successfully generated, a Data Processing Engine job closes the payout periods. This flow includes the other flows as subflows.\nSEE ALSO\nFlow Builder\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\nÂ ",
