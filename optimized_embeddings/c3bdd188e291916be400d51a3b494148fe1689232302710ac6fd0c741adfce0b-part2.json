If you have permission to switch between Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, the link to do so is located here, too.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nIn Salesforce Classic, your profile menu is your name. Same concept in Lightning Experience, although now you’re represented by an avatar (1).\n\nClick your name to access your profile page, or click Settings to update your personal information (2).\n\nBy the way, you look like this by default in Lightning Experience: . That’s probably not a great likeness, so upload a photo of yourself from your profile page.\n\nIf your company hasn’t fully transitioned to Lightning Experience, you may still have access to Salesforce Classic. To head back to Salesforce Classic, use the Switcher (3). When you’re ready to return to Lightning Experience, find the Switcher in the Salesforce Classic header or in your profile menu. Each time you switch, we remember your choice and set it as your default environment. If you don’t have permission to access Salesforce Classic, the Switcher doesn’t appear in your profile menu.\n\nIf you have multiple usernames, or have accounts in multiple Salesforce orgs, you can quickly switch between usernames in Lightning Experience. Simply click the Add Username link to specify your login credentials (4). Then click entries in the Usernames section to toggle between usernames without needing to log in again (5). These options don’t appear in your profile menu if your admin disabled this feature or if you have only one username.\n\nIf you want to change how much information you see on the screen, mix it up with the display density (6). Want a more spacious view? Comfy has labels on the top of fields and more space between page elements. Users who want an info-packed screen might prefer Compact, which has labels to the left of fields and less space between page elements. Changing the density instantly reloads the page, so save any changes beforehand. If you have multiple browser tabs open, you may need to refresh the other tabs to see the new display density setting. Density display doesn’t change the page layout and doesn’t apply to Digital Experiences or the Salesforce mobile app.\n\nSEE ALSO\nProfiles\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
