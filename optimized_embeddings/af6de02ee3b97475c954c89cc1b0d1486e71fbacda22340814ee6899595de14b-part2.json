This code is mapped to a Salesforce result code.\nGateway Result Code Description\tThe description of the gateway result code.\nIP Address\tThe IP address of the user who initiated the payment adjustment.\nMAC Address\tThe MAC address of the user who initiated the payment adjustment.\nPayment Authorization Adjust Number\tThe auto-generated ID number of the payment authorization adjustment.\nPayment Authorization\tThe payment authorization associated with the payment adjustment.\nPhone\tThe phone number of the customer who made the original payment associated with the adjustment.\nProcessing Mode\t\n\nIndicates whether the payment adjustment was made outside of the Salesforce platform.\n\nPossible values are:\n\nExternal—The transaction occurred outside of the Salesforce payment platform.\nSalesforce—Salesforce made and recorded an external call to the payment gateway.\n\nSalesforce Result Code\t\n\nThe Salesforce result code for the payment adjustment transaction.

For example, the customer had insufficient funds or briefly lost their connection.\nIndeterminate—The gateway didn’t respond to the call. This response usually happens when Salesforce times out while waiting for a response from the gateway.\nPermanent Fail: The gateway call failed and won’t work even if tried again. Gateway calls fail permanently for one of two reasons:\nHard Decline—The customer’s payment account has been closed or terminated.\nFraud—The gateway recognized the payment or payment method as known fraud\nRequires Review—The customer’s bank requires more information before completing the payment.\nSuccess—The gateway call succeeded.\nSystem Error—Salesforce ended the payment request before receiving a response. For example, Salesforce lost credentials or access to its server. Salesforce ends payment calls if it doesn’t receive a response from the gateway within two minutes.\nValidation Error—Customer payment data was incorrect. For example, the payment was submitted with a misspelling in the credit card address or an incorrect CVV.\n\nStatus\t\n\nIndicates the status of the payment adjustment transaction.\n\nPossible values are:\n\nCanceled—The payment adjustment has been voided and can no longer be allocated.\nDraft—The payment adjustment can be edited before posting it and allocating it to a target.\nProcessed—The payment adjustment has been finalized and can be allocated against a target.\nSEE ALSO\nOrder Management Objects and Fields\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
