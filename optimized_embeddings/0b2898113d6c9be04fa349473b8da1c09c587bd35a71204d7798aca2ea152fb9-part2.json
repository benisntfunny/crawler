If you’re doing a “big bang” rollout, set up everyone in your org. But if you’re taking a phased approach, set up just the users for your pilot group (and so on).\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\nNOTE On January 7, 2020, the Turn on Lightning Experience critical update automatically enabled Lightning Experience for orgs that hadn’t already done so. So that’s one less thing for you to do in the rollout phase! If you want to confirm that Lightning Experience is on for your org, use the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant. See Verify that Lightning Experience is Turned On for more details.\nSet Up User Access to Lightning Experience\nAs you execute your rollout plan to launch Lightning Experience, make sure that the right users are getting access to the new interface. You can fine-tune access with permission sets and custom profiles, which is great for doing a phased rollout to a pilot group or specific teams of users. Or go for it and set your entire organization loose if things are ready for everyone. You can also control who immediately switches to the new interface, who stays in Salesforce Classic until they switch themselves, and who can’t switch back to the classic interface. The power is yours.\nMake Lightning Experience the Default Interface\nGive users who are trained and ready to work in Lightning Experience a head start. Use the Switch Users tool in the Lightning Experience Transition Assistant to assign the new interface as a user’s default experience, on a user-by-user basis.\nSEE ALSO\nSupported Editions and User Licenses for Lightning Experience\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
