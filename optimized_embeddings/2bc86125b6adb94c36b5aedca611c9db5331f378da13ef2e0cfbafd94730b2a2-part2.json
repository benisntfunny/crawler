This is the time to kick off your change management strategy. And time to get busy on release development activities, including implementing Lightning Experience features and addressing the priority issues noted in your Readiness Report. The last piece is going live by giving users access to the new interface!\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions\n\nBecause your rollout is an iterative process, you repeat some of these steps until you’ve moved all users to the new interface. Remember, you don’t have to fix everything ahead of time.\n\nEnlist Champions to Validate Your Lightning Experience Rollout Priorities\nThanks to your Lightning Experience Readiness Report and the rest of the data you gathered in your evaluation stage, you have a good sense of the scope of work for your pilot and subsequent rollout groups. But before you actually start the work, take a little time to validate your priorities by testing the default state of Lightning Experience. Ask a champion user in the upcoming rollout group to take the new interface for a test drive, and then get their feedback on what’s working and what’s not. This feedback may reveal that things you thought were problems aren’t and that you haven’t accounted for features or processes that the rollout group needs.\nPrepare Your Users for Lightning Experience with Change Management\nKick off change management activities now and keep them up throughout the transition. Busy users aren’t always receptive to change so your focus at this point is to win hearts and minds with communication, collaboration, training, and even a little bit of marketing. The Lightning Experience Transition Change Management Hub and Lightning Experience Enablement Pack give you guidance and tools to ensure that your users are well prepared for your launch.\nImplement Lightning Experience Features\nTake advantage of the hundreds of innovative features in Lightning Experience to transform how users work. There’s a lot to choose from, so start with the features that best benefit the users in the current rollout group. Then keep iterating over time to add even more value.\nAdjust Your Existing Customizations\nMost of your Salesforce customizations just work in Lightning Experience. But there might be some aspects of your implementation that require a little attention for best results in the new interface. Use the Lightning Experience Readiness Report, the Lightning Experience Configuration Converter, and good old fashioned testing to figure out where things stand.\nLaunch Lightning Experience to Your Users\nWhen it’s launch time, set up access to Lightning Experience for the intended group of users. If you’re doing a “big bang” rollout, set up everyone in your org. But if you’re taking a phased approach, set up just the users for your pilot group (and so on).\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
