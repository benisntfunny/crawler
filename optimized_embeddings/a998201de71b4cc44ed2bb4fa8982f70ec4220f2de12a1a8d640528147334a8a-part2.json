Synchronized Data Sources synchronize data from your Salesforce account at defined time intervals, including data schemas and relationships previously established in your Salesforce CRM account.\n\nSynchronized Data Sources Prerequisites\n\nTo use Synchronized Data Sources, your account must use Contact Builder and Marketing Cloud Connect (version 5). Contact your account executive to enable Synchronized Data Sources.\n\nEnsure that your Salesforce System User account remains active and that you know the password.\n\nWhen integrating multiple business units in your account, use a single integration user for no more than five business units.\n\nComplete the implementation for your Sales or Service Cloud org and allow that org to completely populate with data before you set up your Synchronized Data Sources. This step allows the process to complete with less load on the system.\n\nNOTE Marketing Cloud Connect supports objects that use a version one less than the API version that your Salesforce account is using. If the API version isn’t the latest production version available, some new objects or features aren’t supported in Synchronized Data Sources.\nSynchronization and Synchronized Data Sources\n\nSynchronized Data Sources let you use information from Sales Cloud and Service Cloud sources as part of your marketing activities:\n\nPersonalization using up-to-date information from multiple sources\nDynamic content using information from multiple sources\nAdditional information from Salesforce Custom Objects\nTrack synchronization using an activity log and Contact Builder with Synchronized Data Sources.\nMulti-Org and Synchronized Data Sources\n\nSynchronized Data Sources permit a single active Salesforce system user to connect to multiple Engagement business units. Each business unit that connects using the same active Salesforce system user integrates using the same data model. That integration ensures that these integrated business units receive the same data synchronized from Sales Cloud and can access that data for use in marketing activities. Actions taken to update a data source, such as adding or removing a field, reflect in all business units integrated with the Salesforce system user. Because these actions can affect multiple business units, understand the implications of any data source change in a multi-org environment. We support up to five business units to the same tracking user in a multi-org environment. If you use more than five business units, service can be degraded and can negatively impact the servers.\n\nTime Zones and Synchronized Data Sources\n\nSynced data and time information is changed to United States Central Standard Time when it’s stored in Engagement. For example, a birthday stored as 09/29/2019 00:00 AM in Sales Cloud in GMT changes to 09/28/2019 07:00 PM in Marketing Cloud.\n\nRecords in synced data extensions always display in CST, regardless of the time zone set for your user in other parts of the Engagement app. Use an offset when you manipulate date and time information that’s synced from Sales Cloud to Engagement.\n\nImplement Synchronized Data Sources in Contact Builder\nImplement Synchronized Data Sources in Contact Builder.\nCreate Synchronized Data Sources in Contact Builder\nAfter you integrate Marketing Cloud Connect and link a data source in Contact Builder, your synchronized data source appears in the Data Sources section. This process takes some time to complete.\nEdit Synchronization Settings\nEdit synchronization settings in Contact Builder for a previously configured data source. You can filter how often synchronization occurs and filter the record collection. Editing an already synchronized object causes a refresh for that object.\nInteract with Synchronized Data Sources\nBefore you add a data source to Contact Builder, configure the original data source and allow changes to synchronize to Marketing Cloud Engagement. You can’t import data to a synchronized data source from Contact Builder.\nDisconnect Synchronized Data Sources\nTo disconnect synchronized data sources, disconnect Marketing Cloud Connect. As part of this process, Synchronized Data Sources removes all synchronized data extensions, the Contacts attribute group, and the synchronized data source. Only disconnect these tools when necessary, because data is removed from Marketing Cloud Engagement, which can disrupt your marketing activities.\nDID THIS ARTICLE SOLVE YOUR ISSUE?\nLet us know so we can improve!\nYes\nNo\n ",
