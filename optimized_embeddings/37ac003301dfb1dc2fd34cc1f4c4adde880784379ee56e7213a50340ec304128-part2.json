Ship and Debit Process Management gives manufacturers the ability to craft an end-to-end ship and debit process to compensate partners who sell competitively priced products and deftly react to market conditions.\n\nREQUIRED EDITIONS\nAvailable in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions that have Rebate Management or Ship and Debit Process Management enabled.\n\nYou can build and scale your rebate programs and ship and debit programs, view incentive performance and business performance in parallel, and automate payout and claim amount calculations. You can also share threshold attainment and intelligent insights with sales teams and partners. It’s easier to drive real-time partner collaboration, now that everyone is operating off a single source of truth.\n\nGet Started with Rebate Management\nRebates are monetary incentives that businesses use to reward their partners when they meet an agreed-upon sales target. Manufacturers give rebates to partners to build deeper loyalty and drive the desired channel purchasing behavior. Use Rebate Management to create rebate programs and define an incentive structure with benefits and corresponding qualification thresholds. Explore a trial org and then learn about what’s included, what setup we recommend, and how to get ready for your implementation.\nGet Started with Ship and Debit Process Management\nShip and debit incentives are rebates that manufacturers give to partners for selling competitively priced products to customers. Manufacturers adjust product prices to protect their partners’ margins and to incentivize partners to repeat business. Use Ship and Debit Process Management to create ship and debit programs and set up special prices and discounts that partners receive for different products. Explore a trial org and then learn about what’s included, what setup we recommend, and how to get ready for your implementation.\nLearn About Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management\nUnderstand the capabilities of Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management and review what business objectives can be achieved with each feature. Explore the different workflows and data models for Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management. Learn about key roles and terms in Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management.\nSet Up Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management\nSet up features for Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management. Enable the required features in Setup. Assign users the necessary permission sets. Set up object access, and configure the required settings for Experience Cloud site.\nConfigure and Customize Rebate Management\nPopulate transaction journals in your org to use in rebate payout calculations. Create custom objects and fields for specific business use cases. Enhance the experience for users with automated approvals.\nStreamline Payout Calculations for Rebates\nUse Data Processing Engine (DPE) definitions to transform data stored in various standard or custom objects in your org and to write back the results to a target object. Query, filter, and aggregate Transaction Journal records for rebate calculation. Choose the correct DPE definition for your use case. Clone and customize predefined definitions or create a definition, and then activate the definitions.\nCreate and Manage Rebate Programs\nCreate a rebate program to reward your partners when they attain specific sales targets. Enroll program members and create payout periods. Set up rebate types within a rebate program. Add benefits, additional benefit criteria, and eligibility rules for rebate types. Track transactions and aggregated payout data for members.\nCreate and Manage Ship and Debit Programs\nCompensate partners when they competitively price their products to react to evolving market conditions, attract new customers, or build deeper relationships with existing customers. Rebate program managers can create effective, flexible ship and debit rebate programs to incentivize their partners. They enroll partners, dealers, and distributors as well as ship-to partners and customers to these programs. Rebate program managers can optimize the special prices and discounts offered to partners by defining the right mix of special pricing terms and benefits.\nManage Rebate and Ship and Debit Claims\nPartners can upload claims for standard rebates and ship and debit rebates and invoices as proof-of-sale documents through the Experience Cloud site. Admins convert these documents into Transaction Journal records to use for rebate payout processing and calculation. Partners can also view rebate information such as the programs they’re enrolled in.\nOrchestrate Rebate Payout Calculations\nAutomate the rebate calculation process with configurable predefined flows. Schedule the flows at regular intervals. Use predefined flow actions to customize the rebate process as required. Configure an end-to-end orchestration flow to manage the rebate lifecycle. Use Batch Management capabilities to process a large number of filtered and aggregated transaction records in manageable chunks.\nProcess Ship and Debit Claims\nBuild an end-to-end process to validate ship and debit claims, to verify their eligibility for benefits, and to calculate payouts by using declarative process automation tools. Automated processes help your company minimize turnaround times, boost the efficiency of ship and debit claim analysts, and prevent manual errors. Use the preconfigured, scalable templates for flows and Business Rules Engine expression sets as-is, or as a reference to build your own processes.\nTrack and Adjust Rebate Payouts\nView the payout details for rebate program members in a single snapshot. Track these details at any point in time, and also when they’re finalized. Recalculate payouts if necessary. Adjust payouts as required and submit them for approval.\nTrack and Adjust Ship and Debit Claim Amounts\nView pricing, payout, and processing information of the ship and debit claims submitted by partners. Track the amount of ship and debit incentive for a product that a program member has already claimed. Adjust the ship and debit claim amounts and get the adjustments approved.\nManage Rebates and Incentives Within Sales Processes\nCraft better deals and make the right incentive decisions within your existing sales and Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) processes. Account managers, sales teams, dealers, distributors, and rebate managers can better visualize an account’s rebate attainment, view projected rebate amounts on transactions, make informed decisions, and better negotiate deals. They can view rebates an account is earning from in the context of a sales transaction, or select eligible rebate types and add them to the transaction. All applicable incentives are visible in the context of the transaction be it a Quote, Opportunity, Order, Sales Agreement, Contract, or any other transaction.\nView the Rebates and Incentives Attainment Snapshot on Accounts\nEnsure that account managers and channel partners are equipped with key rebate and incentive insights so that they can create mutually beneficial deals and maximize earnings. The Program Rebate Types panel on an account displays the account's rebate types and shows progress against those rebates based on the current date.\nDeploy and Use Rebate Analytics\nRebate Analytics dashboards give you actionable insights that help you improve your programs and increase product sales. The embedded dashboards give you immediate insights into incentives for your orders, sales agreement products, and rebate programs from Salesforce pages you use everyday. The Einstein Discovery for Rebate Management app lets you predict rebate-driven sales, identify high-potential accounts to add to rebate programs, and recommend top rebate programs to your customers.\nExtend Rebate Management with Prebuilt Apps\nUse prebuilt apps for Rebate Management to get started with your implementation. These apps include custom metadata, permission sets, Data Processing Engine templates, flow templates, and more. While you can easily access these apps using the Manufacturing Cloud learning trial org, the apps can be extended for other industry-specific implementations using Rebate Management.\nConsiderations and Limitations for Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management\nReview these considerations before you start working with Rebate Management and Ship and Debit Process Management.\nChecklist to Run a Rebate Program\nReview the high-level procedure to configure, create, and manage a standard rebate program.
